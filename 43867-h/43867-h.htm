<h2><a id="PREFACE" href="#toc">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book makes no pretensions to originality. It has
taken the best from every source. The author believes
the matter has been arranged in a more simple and effective
manner, and that more information has been crowded
into these pages than will be found within the pages of
any similar book.</p>

<p>The professional engineer, in writing a book for young
engineers, is likely to forget that the novice is unfamiliar
with many terms which are like daily bread to him. The
present writers have tried to avoid that pitfall, and to
define each term as it naturally needs definition. Moreover,
the description of parts and the definitions of terms
have preceded any suggestions on operation, the authors
believing that the young engineer should become thoroughly
familiar with his engine and its manner of working,
before he is told what is best to do and not to do.
If he is forced on too fast he is likely to get mixed. The
test questions at the end of <a href="#CHAPTER_III" class="int-ref">Chapter III</a>. will show how
perfectly the preceding pages have been mastered, and
the student is not ready to go on till he can answer all
these questions readily.</p>

<p>The system of questions and answers has its uses and
its limitations. The authors have tried to use that system
where it would do most good, and employ the straight
narrative discussion method where questions could not
help and would only interrupt the progress of thought.
Little technical matter has been introduced, and that only
for practical purposes. The authors have had traction
engines in mind for the most part, but the directions will
apply equally well to any kind of steam engine.</p>

<p>The thanks of the publishers are due to the various
traction engine and threshing machine manufacturers
<a id="Page_6" href="#Page_6" class="pagenum" title="6"> </a>
for cuts and information, and especially to the <i>Threshermen’s
Review</i> for ideas contained in its “Farm Engine
Economy,” to the J.&nbsp;I. Case Threshing Machine Co. for
the use of copyrighted matter in their “The Science of
Successful Threshing,” and to the manager of the Columbus
Machine Co. for valuable personal information furnished
the authors on gasoline engines and how to run
them. The proof has been read and corrected by Mr. T.&nbsp;R.
Butman, known in Chicago for 25 years as one of the
leading experts on engines and boilers, especially boilers.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">BUYING AN ENGINE.</span></h2>


<p>There are a great many makes of good engines on the
market to-day, and the competition is so keen that no
engine maker can afford to turn out a very poor engine.
This is especially true of traction engines. The different
styles and types all have their advantages, and are good
in their way. For all that, one good engine may be valueless
for you, and there are many ways in which you may
make a great mistake in purchasing an engine. The following
points will help you to choose wisely:</p>

<p>1. Consider what you want an engine for. If it is a
stationary engine, consider the work to be done, the
space it is to occupy, and what conveniences will save
your time. Remember, TIME IS MONEY, and that
means that SPACE IS ALSO MONEY. Choose the
kind of engine that will be most convenient for the position
in which you wish to place it and the purpose or
purposes for which you wish to use it. If buying a traction
engine, consider also the roads and an engine’s pulling
qualities.</p>

<p>2. If you are buying a traction engine for threshing,
the first thing to consider is FUEL. Which will be
cheapest for you, wood, coal or straw? Is economy of
fuel much of an object with you—one that will justify
you in greater care and more scientific study of your
engine? Other things being equal, the direct flue, firebox,
<a id="Page_8" href="#Page_8" class="pagenum" title="8"> </a>
locomotive boiler and simple engine will be the best, since
they are the easiest to operate. They are not the most
economical under favorable conditions, but a return flue
boiler and a compound engine will cost you far more
than the possible saving of fuel unless you manage them
in a scientific way. Indeed, if not rightly managed they
will waste more fuel than the direct flue locomotive boiler
and the simple engine.</p>

<p>3. Do not try to economize on the size of your boiler,
and at the same time never get too large an engine. If
a 6-horse power boiler will just do your work, an 8-horse
power will do it better and more economically, because
you won’t be overworking it all the time. Engines should
seldom be crowded. At the same time you never know
when you may want a higher capacity than you have, or
how much you may lose by not having it. Of course
you don’t want an engine and boiler that are too big, but
you should always allow a fair margin above your anticipated
requirements.</p>

<p>4. Do not try to economize on appliances. You should
have a good pump, a good injector, a good heater, an
extra steam gauge, an extra fusible plug ready to put in,
a flue expander and a beader. You should also certainly
have a good force pump and hose to clean the boiler, and
the best oil and grease you can get. Never believe the
man who tells you that something not quite the best is
just as good. You will find it the most expensive thing
you ever tried—if you have wit enough to find out how
expensive it is.</p>

<p>5. If you want my personal advice on the proper engine
to select for various purposes, I should say by all
means get a gasoline engine for small powers about the
farm, such as pumping, etc. It is the quickest to start,
by far the most economical to operate, and the simplest
to manage. The day of the small steam engine is past
and will never return, and ten gasoline engines of this
kind are sold for every steam engine put out. If you
want a traction engine for threshing, etc., stick to steam.
Gasoline engines are not very good hill climbers because
the application of power is not steady enough; they are
<a id="Page_9" href="#Page_9" class="pagenum" title="9"> </a>
not very good to get out of mud holes with for the same
reason, and as yet they are not perfected for such purposes.
You might use a portable gasoline engine, however,
though the application of power is not as steady
as with steam and the flywheels are heavy. In choosing
a traction steam engine, the direct flue locomotive boiler
and simple engine, though theoretically not so economical
as the return flue boiler and compound engine, will in
many cases prove so practically because they are so much
simpler and there is not the chance to go wrong with
them that there is with the others. If for any reason
you want a very quick steamer, buy an upright. If economy
of fuel is very important and you are prepared to
make the necessary effort to secure it, a return flue boiler
will be a good investment, and a really good compound
engine may be. Where a large plant is to be operated
and a high power constant and steady energy is demanded,
stick to steam, since the gasoline engines of the
larger size have not proved so successful, and are certainly
by no means so steady; and in such a case the
exhaust steam can be used for heating and for various
other purposes that will work the greatest economy. For
such a plant choose a horizontal tubular boiler, set in
masonry, and a compound engine (the latter if you have
a scientific engineer).</p>

<p>In general, in the traction engine, look to the convenience
of arrangement of the throttle, reverse lever, steering
wheel, friction clutch, independent pump and injector,
all of which should be within easy reach of the footboard,
as such an arrangement will save annoyance and
often damage when quick action is required.</p>

<p>The boiler should be well set; the firebox large, with
large grate surface if a locomotive type of boiler is used,
and the number of flues should be sufficient to allow good
combustion without forced draft. A return flue boiler
should have a large main flue, material of the required
5-16-inch thickness, a mud drum, and four to six hand-holes
suitably situated for cleaning the boiler. There
should be a rather high average boiler pressure, as high
pressure is more economical than low. For a simple engine,
<a id="Page_10" href="#Page_10" class="pagenum" title="10"> </a>
80 pounds and for a compound 125 pounds should
be minimum.</p>

<p>A stationary engine should have a solid foundation
built by a mason who understands the business, and
should be in a light, dry room—never in a dark cellar
or a damp place.</p>

<p>Every farm traction engine should have a friction
clutch.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">BOILERS.</span></h2>


<p>The first boilers were made as a single cylinder of
wrought iron set in brick work, with provision for a fire
under one end. This was used for many years, but it produced
steam very slowly and with great waste of fuel.</p>

<p>The first improvement to be made in this was a fire
flue running the whole length of the interior of the boiler,
with the fire in one end of the flue. This fire flue was
entirely surrounded by water.</p>

<p>Then a boiler was made with two flues that came together
at the smoke-box end. First one flue was fired
and then the other, alternately, the clear heat of one
burning the smoke of the other when it came into the
common passage.</p>

<p>The next step was to introduce conical tubes by which
the water could circulate through the main fire flue (Galloway
boiler).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_011">

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 1. ORR &amp; SEMBOWER’S STANDARD HORIZONTAL
BOILER, WITH FULL-ARCH FRONT SETTING.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_12" href="#Page_12" class="pagenum" title="12"> </a>

<p>The object of all these improvements was to get larger
heating surface. To make steam rapidly and economically,
the heating surface must be as large as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_012">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="600" height="320" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 2. GAAR, SCOTT &amp; CO.’S LOCOMOTIVE BOILER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But there is a limit in that the boiler must not be cumbersome,
it must carry enough water, and have sufficient
space for steam.</p>
<a id="Page_13" href="#Page_13" class="pagenum" title="13"> </a>

<p>The stationary boiler now most commonly used is cylindrical,
the fire is built in a brick furnace under the
sheet and returns through fire tubes running the length
of the boiler. (<a href="#i_011" class="int-ref">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>


<h3>LOCOMOTIVE FIRE TUBE TYPE OF BOILER.</h3>

<p>The earliest of the modern steam boilers to come into
use was the locomotive fire tube type, with a special firebox.
By reference to the illustration (<a href="#i_012" class="int-ref">Fig. 2</a>) you will
see that the boiler cylinder is perforated with a number
of tubes from 2 to 4 inches in diameter running from the
large firebox on the left, through the boiler cylinder filled
with water, to the smoke-box on the right, above which
the smokestack rises.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_013">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="550" height="372" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 3. THE HUBER FIRE BOX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the walls of the firebox are
double, and that the water circulates freely all about the
firebox as well as all about the fire tubes. The inner walls
of the firebox are held firmly in position by stay bolts, as
will be seen in <a href="#i_013" class="int-ref">Fig. 3</a>, which also shows the position of
the grate.</p>
<a id="Page_14" href="#Page_14" class="pagenum" title="14"> </a>

<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 4. HUBER RETURN FLUE BOILER.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_15" href="#Page_15" class="pagenum" title="15"> </a>


<h3>RETURN FLUE TYPE OF BOILER.</h3>

<p>The return flue type of boiler consists of a large central
fire flue running through the boiler cylinder to the
smoke box at the front end, which is entirely closed. The
smoke passes back through a number of small tubes, and
the smokestack is directly over the fire at the rear of the
boiler, though there is no communication between the fire
at the rear of the boiler and it except through the main flue
to the front and back through
the small return flues. <a href="#i_014" class="int-ref">Fig. 4</a>
illustrates this type of
boiler, though it shows but
one return flue. The actual
number may be seen by the
sectional view in
<a href="#i_015" class="int-ref">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_015">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="372" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 5. SECTION VIEW OF HUBER RETURN
FLUE BOILER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The fire is built
in one end of the
main flue, and is
entirely surrounded
by water, as
will be seen in the
illustration. The
long passage for
the flame and
heated gases enables
the water to
absorb a maximum
amount of the heat
of combustion.
There is also an
element of safety in
this boiler in that the small flues will be exposed first
should the water become low, and less damage will be done
than if the large crown sheet of the firebox boiler is exposed,
and this large crown sheet is the first thing to be
exposed in that type of boiler.</p>


<h3>WATER TUBE TYPE OF BOILER.</h3>

<p>The special difference between the fire tube boiler and
the water tube boiler is that in the former the fire passes
<a id="Page_16" href="#Page_16" class="pagenum" title="16"> </a>
through the tubes, while in the latter the water is in the
tubes and the fire passes around them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_016">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="322" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>FIG. 6. FREEMAN VERTICAL BOILER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this type of boiler there is an upper cylinder (or
more than one) filled with water; a series of small tubes
running at an angle from the front or fire door end of the
upper cylinder to a point below and back of the grates,
<a id="Page_17" href="#Page_17" class="pagenum" title="17"> </a>
where they meet in another cylinder or pipe, which is
connected with the other end of the upper cylinder. The
portions of the tubes directly over the fire will be hottest,
and the water here will become heated and rise to
the front end of the upper cylinder, while to fill the space
left, colder water is drawn in from the back pipe, from
the rear end of the upper cylinder, down to the lower ends
of the water tubes, to pass along up through them to the
front end again.</p>

<p>This type of boiler gives great heating surface, and
since the tubes are small they will have ample strength
with much thinner walls. Great freedom of circulation
is important in this type of boiler, there being no contracted
cells in the passage. This is not adapted for a
portable engine.</p>


<h3>UPRIGHT OR VERTICAL TYPE OF BOILER.</h3>

<p>In the upright type of boiler the boiler cylinder is
placed on end, the fire is built at the lower end, which
is a firebox surrounded by a water jacket, and the smoke
and gases of combustion rise straight up through vertical
fire flues. The amount of water carried is relatively
small, and the steam space is also small, while the heating
surface is relatively large if the boiler is sufficiently
tall. You can get up steam in this type of boiler quicker
than in any other, and in case of the stationary engine,
the space occupied is a minimum. The majority of small
stationary engines have this type of boiler, and there is
a traction engine with upright boiler which has been
widely used, but it is open to the objection that the upper
or steam ends of the tubes easily get overheated and so
become leaky. There is also often trouble from mud and
scale deposits in the water leg, the bottom area of which
is very small.</p>


<h3>DEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN CONNECTION WITH BOILERS.</h3>

<p><i>Shell</i>—The main cylindrical steel sheets which form
the principal part of the boiler.</p>

<p><i>Boiler-heads</i>—The ends of the boiler cylinder.</p>
<a id="Page_18" href="#Page_18" class="pagenum" title="18"> </a>

<p><i>Tube Sheets</i>—The sheets in which the fire tubes are
inserted at each end of the boiler.</p>

<p><i>Fire-box</i>—A nearly square space at one end of a
boiler, in which the fire is placed. Properly it is surrounded
on all sides by a double wall, the space between
the two shells of these walls being filled with water. All
flat surfaces are securely fastened by stay bolts and crown
bars, but cylindrical surfaces are self-bracing.</p>

<p><i>Water-leg</i>—The space at sides of fire-box and below
it in which water passes.</p>

<p><i>Crown-sheet</i>—The sheet of steel at the top of the firebox,
just under the water in the boiler. This crown sheet
is exposed to severe heat, but so long as it is covered
with water, the water will conduct the heat away, and
the metal can never become any hotter than the water in
the boiler. If, however, it is not covered with water, but
only by steam, it quickly becomes overheated, since the
steam does not conduct the heat away as the water does.
It may become so hot it will soften and sag, but the great
danger is that the thin layer of water near this overheated
crown sheet will be suddenly turned into a great
volume of steam and cause an explosion. If some of the
pressure is taken off, this overheated water may suddenly
burst into steam and cause an explosion, as the safety
valve blows off, for example (since the safety valve relieves
some of the pressure).</p>

<p><i>Smoke-box</i>—The space at the end of the boiler opposite
to that of the fire, in which the smoke may accumulate
before passing up the stack in the locomotive type,
or through the small flues in the return type of boiler.</p>

<p><i>Steam-dome</i>—A drum or projection at the top of the
boiler cylinder, forming the highest point which the steam
can reach. The steam is taken from the boiler through
piping leading from the top of this dome, since at this
point it is least likely to be mixed with water, either
through foaming or shaking up of the boiler. Even under
normal conditions the steam at the top of the dome is
drier than anywhere else.</p>

<p><i>Mud-drum</i>—A cylindrical-shaped receptacle at the bottom
of the boiler similar to the steam-dome at the top,
<a id="Page_19" href="#Page_19" class="pagenum" title="19"> </a>
but not so deep. Impurities in the water accumulate
here, and it is of great value on a return flue boiler. In
a locomotive boiler the mud accumulates in the water leg,
below the firebox.</p>

<p><i>Man-holes</i>—Are large openings into the interior of a
boiler, through which a man may pass to clean out the
inside.</p>

<p><i>Hand-holes</i>—Are smaller holes at various points in the
boiler into which the nozzle of a hose may be introduced
for cleaning out the interior. All these openings must be
securely covered with steam-tight plates, called man-hole
and hand-hole plates.</p>

<p><i>A boiler jacket</i>—A non-conducting covering of wood,
plaster, hair, rags, felt, paper, asbestos or the like, which
prevents the boiler shell from cooling too rapidly through
radiation of heat from the steel. These materials are
usually held in place against the boiler by sheet iron. An
intervening air-space between the jacket and the boiler
shell will add to the efficiency of the jacket.</p>

<p><i>A steam-jacket</i>—A space around an engine cylinder or
the like which may be filled with live steam so as to keep
the interior from cooling rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Ash-pit</i>—The space directly under the grates, where
the ashes accumulate.</p>

<p><i>Dead-plates</i>—Solid sheets of steel on which the fire
lies the same as on the grates, but with no openings
through to the ash-pit. Dead-plates are sometimes used
to prevent cold air passing through the fire into the flues,
and are common on straw-burning boilers. They should
seldom if ever be used on coal or wood firing boilers.</p>

<p><i>Grate Surface</i>—The whole space occupied by the grate-bars,
usually measured in square feet.</p>

<p><i>Forced Draft</i>—A draft produced by any means other
than the natural tendency of the heated gases of combustion
to rise. For example, a draft caused by letting
steam escape into the stack.</p>

<p><i>Heating Surface</i>—The entire surface of the boiler exposed
to the heat of the fire, or the area of steel or iron
sheeting or tubing, on one side of which is water and
on the other heated air or gases.</p>
<a id="Page_20" href="#Page_20" class="pagenum" title="20"> </a>

<p><i>Steam-space</i>—The cubical contents of the space which
may be occupied by steam above the water.</p>

<p><i>Water-space</i>—The cubical contents of the space occupied
by water below the steam.</p>

<p><i>Diaphragm-plate</i>—A perforated plate used in the
domes of locomotive boilers to prevent water dashing into
the steam supply pipe. A dry-pipe is a pipe with small
perforations, used for taking steam from the steam-space,
instead of from a dome with diaphragm-plate.</p>


<h3>THE ATTACHMENTS OF A BOILER.<a id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker" title="Footnote 1">1</a></h3>

<p>Before proceeding to a consideration of the care and
management of a boiler, let us briefly indicate the chief
working attachments of a boiler. Unless the nature and
uses of these attachments are fully understood, it will be
impossible to handle the boiler in a thoroughly safe and
scientific fashion, though some engineers
do handle boilers without knowing all
about these attachments. Their ignorance
in many cases costs them their lives
and the lives of others.</p>

<p>The first duty of the engineer is to see
that the boiler is filled with water. This
he usually does by looking at the glass
water-gauge.</p>


<h3>THE WATER GAUGE AND COCKS.</h3>

<div class="figright w200" id="i_020">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="141" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>TWO-ROD WATER
GAUGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a cock at each end of the glass
tube. When these cocks are open the
water will pass through the lower into
the glass tube, while steam comes
through the other. The level of the water
in the gauge will then be the same
as the level of the water in the boiler,
and the water should never fall out of
sight below the lower end of the glass, nor rise above the
upper end.</p>
<a id="Page_21" href="#Page_21" class="pagenum" title="21"> </a>

<p>Below the lower gauge cock there is another cock used
for draining the gauge and blowing it off when there is
a pressure of steam on. By occasionally opening this
cock, allowing the heated water or steam to blow through
it, the engineer may always be sure that the passages
into the water gauge are not stopped up by any means.
By closing the upper cock and opening the lower, the
passage into the lower may be cleared by blowing off the
drain cock; by closing the lower gauge cock and opening
the upper the passage from the steam space may be
cleared and tested in the same way when the drain cock
is opened. If the glass breaks, both upper and lower
gauge cocks should be closed instantly.</p>

<div class="figleft w200" id="i_021-a">
<img src="images/i_021-a.jpg" width="194" height="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>GAUGE OR TRY COCK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In addition to the glass water
gauge, there are the try-cocks for
ascertaining the level of the water
in the boiler. There should be two
to four of these. They open directly
out<!--TN: was 'ut'--> of the boiler sheet, and by opening
them in turn it is possible to tell
approximately where the water
stands. There should be one cock
near the level of the crown sheet, or slightly above it, another
about the level of the lower gauge cock, another
about the middle of the gauge, another about the level of
the upper gauge, and still another, perhaps, a little higher.
But one above and one below the water line will be sufficient.
If water stands above the level of the cock, it
will blow off white mist when opened; if the cock opens
from steam-space, it will blow off blue steam when
opened.</p>

<p>The try-cocks should be
opened from time to time
in order to be sure the water
stands at the proper
level in the boiler, for various
things may interfere
with the working of the
glass gauge. Try-cocks are often called gauge cocks.</p>

</div>
<a id="Page_22" href="#Page_22" class="pagenum" title="22"> </a>


<h3>THE STEAM GAUGE.</h3>

<p>The steam gauge is a delicate instrument arranged so
as to indicate by a pointer the pounds of pressure which
the steam is exerting within the boiler. It is extremely
important, and a defect in it may
cause much damage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_022-a">
<img src="images/i_022-a.jpg" width="250" height="274" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PRESSURE GAUGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The steam gauge was invented
in 1849 by Eugene Bourdon, of
France. He discovered that a flat
tube bent in a simple curve, held
fast at one end, would expand and
contract if made of proper spring
material, through the pressure of
the water within the tube. The
free end operates a clock-work that
moves the pointer.</p>

<p>It is important that the steam gauge be attached to
the boiler by a siphon, or with a knot in the tube, so that
the steam may operate on
water contained in the tube,
and the water cannot become
displaced by steam,
since steam might interfere
with the correct working
of the gauge by expanding
the gauge tube through its excessive heat.</p>

<p>Steam gauges frequently get out of order, and should
be tested occasionally. This may conveniently be done
by attaching them to a boiler which has a correct gauge
already on it. If both register alike, it is probable that
both are accurate.</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
<div class="figcenter w350" id="i_022-b">

<div class="caption"><p>FRONT CYLINDER COCK.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are also self-testing steam gauges. With all
pressure off, the pointer will return to 0. Then a series
of weights are arranged which may
be hung on the gauge and cause
the pointer to indicate corresponding
numbers. The chief source of
variation is in the loosening of the
indicator needle. This shows itself
usually when the pressure is off and
the pointer does not return exactly to zero.</p>
<a id="Page_23" href="#Page_23" class="pagenum" title="23"> </a>


<h3>SAFETY VALVE.</h3>

<p>The safety valve is a valve held in place by a weighted
lever<a id="Marker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="marker" title="Footnote 2">2</a> or by a spiral spring (on traction engines) or some
similar device, and is adjustable
by a screw or the
like so that it can be set
to blow off at a given pressure
of steam, usually the
rated pressure of the boiler,
which on traction engines
is from 110 to 130 pounds. The valve is supplied
with a handle by which it can be opened, and it should
be opened occasionally to make sure it is working all
right. When it blows off the steam gauge should be
noted to see that it agrees with the pressure for which
the safety valve was set. If they do not agree, something
is wrong; either the safety valve does not work freely,
or the steam gauge does not register accurately.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SAFETY VALVE.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cut shows the Kunkle safety valve. To set it, unscrew
the jam nut and apply the key to the pressure
screw. For more pressure, screw down; for less, unscrew.
After having the desired pressure, screw the jam
<a id="Page_24" href="#Page_24" class="pagenum" title="24"> </a>
nut down tight on the pressure screw. To regulate the
opening and closing of the valve, take the pointed end of
a file and apply it to the teeth of the regulator. If valve
closes with too much boiler pressure, move the regulator
to the left. If with too little, move the regulator to the
right.</p>

<p>This can be done when the
valve is at the point of blowing
off.</p>

</div>

<p>Other types of valves are managed in a similar way,
and exact directions will always be furnished by the manufacturers.</p>


<h3>FILLING THE BOILER WITH WATER.</h3>

<p>There are three ways in which a boiler is commonly
filled with water.</p>

<p>First, before starting a boiler it must be filled with
water by hand, or with a hand force-pump. There is
usually a filler plug, which must be taken out, and a funnel
can be attached in its place. Open one of the gauge
cocks to let out the air as the water goes in.</p>

<p>When the boiler has a sufficient amount of water, as
may be seen by the glass water gauge, replace the filler
<a id="Page_25" href="#Page_25" class="pagenum" title="25"> </a>
plug. After steam is up the boiler should be supplied
with water by a pump or injector.</p>


<h3>THE BOILER PUMP.</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of pumps commonly used on
traction engines, the Independent pump, and the Cross-head
pump.</p>

<p>The Independent pump is virtually an independent
engine with pump attached. There are two cylinders,
one receiving steam and conveying force to the piston;
the other a water cylinder, in which a plunger works,
drawing the water into itself by suction and forcing it
out through the connection
pipe into the boiler by
force of steam pressure in
the steam cylinder.</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
<div class="figcenter w350" id="i_025-a">
<img src="images/i_025-a.jpg" width="303" height="180" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>STRAIGHT GLOBE VALVE.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter w350" id="i_025-b">
<img src="images/i_025-b.jpg" width="323" height="180" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>ANGLE GLOBE VALVE.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is to be noted that all
suction pumps receive their
water by reason of the
pressure of the atmosphere
on the surface of the water
in the supply tank or well. This atmospheric pressure
is about 15 pounds to the square inch, and is sufficient to
support a column of water 28 to 33 feet high, 33 feet
being the height of a column of water which the atmosphere
will support theoretically at about sea level. At
greater altitudes the pressure of the atmosphere decreases.
Pumps do not work very well when drawing
water from a depth over 20 or 22 feet.</p>

<p>Water can be forced to almost any height by pressure
of steam on the plunger, and it is taken from deep wells
by deep well pumps, which
suck the water 20 to 25
feet, and force it the rest
of the way by pressure on
a plunger.</p>

<p>The amount of water
pumped is regulated by a
cock or globe valve in the
suction pipe.</p>
<a id="Page_26" href="#Page_26" class="pagenum" title="26"> </a>

<p>A Cross-head boiler pump is a pump attached to the
cross-head of an engine. The force of the engine piston
is transmitted to the plunger of the
pump.</p>

<p>The pump portion works exactly
the same, whether of the independent
or cross-head kind.</p>

<p>The cut represents an independent
pump that uses the exhaust
steam to heat the water as it is
pumped (Marsh pump).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_026-a">
<img src="images/i_026-a.jpg" width="181" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>VALVE WITH INTERNAL
SCREW.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Every boiler feed-pump must
have at least two check valves.</p>

<p>A check valve is a small swinging
gate valve (usually) contained
in a pipe, and so arranged that
when water is flowing in one direction
the valve will automatically
open to let the water pass, while
if water should be forced in the
other direction, the valve will automatically close tight
and prevent the water from passing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_026-b">
<img src="images/i_026-b.jpg" width="200" height="183" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SECTIONAL VIEW OF
SWING CHECK VALVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is one check valve in the supply pipe which conducts
the water from the tank or well to the pump cylinder.
When the plunger is drawn
back or raised, a vacuum is created in
the pump cylinder and the outside atmospheric
pressure forces water
through the supply pipe into the cylinder,
and the check valve opens to
let it pass. When the plunger returns,
the check valve closes, and the water
is forced into the feed-pipe to the
boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_027-a">
<img src="images/i_027-a.jpg" width="550" height="201" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SECTIONAL VIEW OF CASE HEATER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are usually two check valves between the pump
cylinder and the boiler, both swinging away from the
pump or toward the boiler. In order that the water may
flow steadily into the boiler there is an air chamber, which
may be partly filled with water at each stroke of the
<a id="Page_27" href="#Page_27" class="pagenum" title="27"> </a>
plunger. As the water comes in, the air must be compressed,
and as it expands it forces the water through the
feed pipe into the boiler in a steady stream. There is one
check valve between the pump cylinder and the air chamber,
to prevent the water from coming back into the cylinder,
and another between the air chamber and the
boiler, to prevent the steam pressure forcing itself or the
water from the boiler or water
heater back into the air chamber.</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
<div class="figcenter w350" id="i_027-b">

<div class="caption"><p>U.&nbsp;S. AUTOMATIC INJECTOR.</p>
<p>(American Injector Co.)</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All three of these check valves must work easily and
fit tight if the pump is to be serviceable. They usually
close with rubber facings which in time will get worn,
<a id="Page_28" href="#Page_28" class="pagenum" title="28"> </a>
and dirt is liable to work into the hinge and otherwise
prevent tight and easy closing. They can always be
opened for inspection, and new ones can be put in when
the old are too much worn.</p>

<p>Only cold water can be pumped successfully, as steam
from hot water will expand, and so prevent a vacuum
being formed. Thus no suction will take place to draw
the water from the supply source.</p>

<p>There should always be a globe valve or cock in the
feed pipe near the boiler to make it possible to cut out the
check valves when the
boiler is under pressure.
<i>It is never to be closed
except</i> when required
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Before passing into
the boiler the water
from the pump goes
through the <i>heater</i>. This
is a small cylinder, with
a coil of pipe inside.
The feed pipe from the
pump is connected with
one end of this inner
coil of pipe, while the
other end of the coil
leads into the boiler itself.
The exhaust
steam from the engine
cylinder is admitted into
the cylinder and passes
around the coil of pipe, afterwards coming out of the
smoke stack to help increase the draft. As the feed
water passes through this heater it becomes heated nearly
to boiling before it enters the boiler, and has no
tendency to cool the boiler off. Heating the feed water
results in an economy of about 10 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_028">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="296" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>AUTOMATIC INJECTOR.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>The Injector</i> is another means of forcing water from
a supply tank or well into the boiler, and at the same time
heating it, by use of steam from the boiler. It is a necessity
<a id="Page_29" href="#Page_29" class="pagenum" title="29"> </a>
when a cross-head pump is used, since such a pump
will not work when the engine is shut down. It is useful
in any case to heat the water before it goes into the
boiler when the engine is not working and there is no
exhaust steam for the heater.</p>

<p>There are various types of injectors, but they all work
on practically the same principle. The steam from the
boiler is led through a tapering nozzle to a small chamber
into which there is an opening from a water supply
pipe. This steam nozzle throws out its spray with great
force and creates a partial vacuum in the chamber, causing
the water to flow in. As the pressure of the steam
has been reduced when it passes into the injector, it cannot,
of course, force its way back into the boiler at first,
and finds an outlet at the overflow. When the water
comes in, however, the steam jet strikes the water and is
condensed by it. At the same time it carries the water
and the condensed steam along toward the boiler with
such force that the back pressure of the boiler is overcome
and a stream of heated water is passed into it. In
order that the injector may work, its parts must be nicely
adjusted, and with varying steam pressures it takes some
ingenuity to get it started. Usually the full steam pressure
is turned on and the cock admitting the water supply
is opened a varying amount according to the pressure.</p>

<p>First the valve between the check
valve and the boiler should be opened,
so that the feed water may enter freely;
then open wide the valve next
the steam dome, and any other
valve between the steam supply pipe
and the injector; lastly open the
water supply valve. If water appears
at the overflow, close the supply
valve and open it again, giving it just
the proper amount of turn. The injector
is regulated by the amount of
water admitted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_029">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="183" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PLAIN WHISTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In setting up an injector of any type,
the following rules should be observed:</p>
<a id="Page_30" href="#Page_30" class="pagenum" title="30"> </a>

<p>All connecting pipes as straight and short as possible.</p>

<p>The internal diameter of all connecting pipes should be
the same or greater than the diameter of the hole in the
corresponding part of the injector.</p>

<p>When there is dirt or particles of wood or other material
in the source of water supply, the end of the
water supply pipe should be provided with a strainer.
Indeed, invariably a strainer should be used. The holes
in this strainer must be as small as the smallest opening
in the delivery tube, and the total area of the openings
in the strainer must be much greater than the area of the
water supply (cross-section).</p>

<p>The steam should be taken from the highest part of
the dome, to avoid carrying any water from the boiler
over with it. Wet steam cuts and grooves the steam
nozzle. The steam should not be taken from the pipe
leading to the engine unless the pipe is quite large.</p>

<p>Before using new injectors, after they are fitted to
the boiler it is advisable to disconnect them and clean
them out well by letting steam blow through them or
forcing water through. This will prevent lead or loose
scale getting into the injector when in use.</p>

<p>Set the injector as low as possible, as it works best
with smallest possible lift.</p>

<p><i>Ejectors and jet pumps</i> are used for lifting and forcing
water by steam pressure, and are employed in filling
tanks, etc.</p>


<h3>BLAST AND BLOW-OFF DEVICES.</h3>

<p>In traction engines there is small pipe with a valve,
leading into the smoke stack from the boiler. When the
valve is opened, the steam allowed to blow off into the
smoke stack will create a vacuum and so increase the
draft. Blast or blow pipes are used only in starting the
fire, and are of little value before the steam pressure
reaches 15 pounds or so.</p>

<p>The exhaust nozzle from the engine cylinder also leads
into the smoke stack, and when the engine is running the
exhaust steam is sufficient to keep up the draft without
using the blower.</p>
<a id="Page_31" href="#Page_31" class="pagenum" title="31"> </a>

<p><i>Blow-off cocks</i> are used for blowing
sediment out of the bottom of a boiler,
or blowing scum off the top of the
water to prevent foaming. A boiler
should never be blown out at high
pressure, as there is great danger of
injuring it. Better let the boiler cool
off somewhat before blowing off.</p>


<h3>SPARK ARRESTER.</h3>

<p>Traction engines are supplied as a
usual thing with spark arresters if
they burn wood or straw. Coal sparks
are heavy and have little life, and with
some engines no spark arrester is
needed. But there is great danger of
setting a fire if an engine is run with wood or straw without
the spark arrester.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_031">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="204" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>DIAMOND
SPARK ARRESTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Spark arresters are of different types. The most usual
form is a large screen dome placed over the top of the
stack. This screen must be kept well cleaned by brushing,
or the draft of the engine will be impaired by it.</p>

<p>In another form of spark arrester, the smoke is made
to pass through water, which effectually kills every possible
spark.</p>

<p>The <i>Diamond Spark Arrester</i> does not interfere with
the draft and is so constructed that all sparks are carried
by a counter current through a tube into a pail where
water is kept. The inverted cone, as shown in cut, is
made of steel wire cloth, which permits smoke and gas
to escape, but no sparks. There is no possible chance to
set fire to anything by sparks. It is adapted to any steam
engine that exhausts into the smoke stack.</p>

<p>The engine is the part of a power plant which converts
steam pressure into power in such form that it can do
work. Properly speaking, the engine has nothing to
do with generating steam. That is done exclusively in
the boiler, which has already been described.</p>

<p>The steam engine was invented by James Watt, in
England, between 1765 and 1790, and he understood all
the essential parts of the engine as now built. It was
improved, however, by Seguin, Ericsson, Stephenson,
Fulton, and many others.</p>

<p>Let us first consider:</p>
<a id="Page_33" href="#Page_33" class="pagenum" title="33"> </a>


<h3>THE STEAM CYLINDER, ITS PARTS AND CONNECTIONS.</h3>

<p>The cylinder proper is constructed of a single piece
of cast iron bored out smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>cylinder heads</i> are the flat discs or caps bolted to
the ends of the cylinder itself. Sometimes one cylinder
head is cast in the same piece with the engine frame.</p>

<p>The <i>piston</i> is a circular disc working back and forth
in the cylinder. It is usually a hollow casting, and to
make it fit the cylinder steam tight, it is supplied on its
circumference with <i>piston rings</i>. These are made of
slightly larger diameter than the piston, and serve as
springs against the sides of the cylinder. The <i>follower
plate</i> and bolts cover the piston rings on the piston head
and hold them in place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_033">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="550" height="343" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CONNECTING ROD AND CROSS-HEAD.</p>
<p>(J.&nbsp;I. Case Threshing Machine Co.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>piston rod</i> is of wrought iron or steel, and is fitted
firmly and rigidly into the piston at one end. It runs
from the piston through one head of the cylinder, passing
through a steam-tight “stuffing box.” One end of the
piston rod is attached to the cross-head.</p>

<p>The <i>cross-head</i> works between <i>guides</i>, and has <i>shoes</i>
above and below. It is practically a joint, necessary in
converting straight back and forth motion into rotary.
The cross-head itself works straight back and forth, just
as the piston does, which is fastened firmly to one end.
At the other end is attached the <i>connecting rod</i>, which
<a id="Page_34" href="#Page_34" class="pagenum" title="34"> </a>
works on a bearing in the cross-head, called the <i>wrist pin</i>,
or cross-head pin.</p>

<p>The <i>connecting rod</i> is wrought iron or steel, working
at one end on the bearing known as the wrist pin, and on
the other on a bearing called the <i>crank pin</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>crank</i> is a short lever which transmits the power
from the connecting rod to the <i>crank shaft</i>. It may also
be a disc, called the <i>crank disc</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CROSS-HEAD.</p>
<p>(J.&nbsp;I. Case Threshing Machine Co.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Let us now return to the steam cylinder itself.</p>

<p>The steam leaves the boiler through a pipe leading
from the top of the steam dome, and is let on or cut off
by the <i>throttle</i> valve, which is usually opened and closed
by some sort of lever handle. It passes on to the<!--TN: printed as new paragraph-->
<i>Steam-chest</i>, usually a part of the same casting as the
cylinder. It has a cover called the <i>steam-chest cover</i>,
which is securely bolted in place.</p>

<p>The <i>steam valve</i>, usually spoken of simply as the <i>valve</i>,
serves to admit the steam alternately to each end of the
cylinder in such a manner that it works the piston back
and forth.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of valves, the simplest (shown
in the diagram) being the D-valve. It slides back and
forth on the bottom of the steam-chest, which is called the
<i>valve seat</i>, and alternately opens and closes the two
<i>steam ports</i>, which are long, narrow passages through
which the steam enters the cylinder, first through one
<a id="Page_35" href="#Page_35" class="pagenum" title="35"> </a>
port to one end, then through the other port to the other
end. The exhaust steam also passes out at these same
ports.</p>

<p>The <i>exhaust chamber</i> in the type of engine now under
consideration is an opening on the lower side of the
valve, and is always open into the <i>exhaust port</i>, which
connects with the exhaust pipe, which finally discharges
itself through the <i>exhaust nozzle</i> into the smoke stack
of a locomotive or traction engine, or in other types of
engines, into the <i>condenser</i>.</p>

<p>The valve is worked by the <i>valve stem</i>, which works
through the valve stem <i>stuffing-box</i>.</p>

<p>Of course the piston does not work quite the full length
of the cylinder, else it would pound against the cylinder
heads.</p>

<p>The <i>clearance</i> is the distance between the cylinder head
at either end and the piston when the piston has reached
the limit of its stroke in that direction.</p>

<p>In most engines the valve is so set that it opens a trifle
just before the piston reaches the limit of its movement
in either direction, thus letting some steam in before the
piston is ready to move back. This opening, which usually
amounts to 1-32 to 3-16 of an inch, is called the
<i>lead</i>. The steam thus let in before the piston reaches the
limit of its stroke forms <i>cushion</i>, and helps the piston to
reverse its motion without any jar, in an easy and silent
manner. Of course the cushion must be as slight as possible
and serve its purpose, else it will tend to stop the
engine, and result in loss of energy. Some engines have
no lead.</p>

<p><i>Setting a valve</i> is adjusting it on its seat so that the
lead will be equal at both ends and sufficient for the needs
of the engine. By shortening the movement of the valve
back and forth, the lead can be increased or diminished.
This is usually effected by changing the eccentric or
valve gear.</p>

<p>The <i>lap</i> of a slide valve is the distance it extends over
the edges of the ports when it is at the middle of its
travel.</p>

<p>Lap on the steam side is called outside lap; lap on the
exhaust side is called inside lap. The object of lap is
<a id="Page_36" href="#Page_36" class="pagenum" title="36"> </a>
to secure the benefit of working steam expansively. Having
lap, the valve closes one steam port before the other
is opened, and before the piston has reached the end of
its stroke; also of course before the exhaust is opened.
Thus for a short time the steam that has been let into the
cylinder to drive the piston is shut up with neither inlet
nor outlet, and it drives the piston by its own expansive
force. When it passes out at the exhaust it has a considerably
reduced pressure, and less of its force is wasted.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the</p>


<h3>VALVE GEAR.</h3>

<p>The mechanism by which the valve is opened and
closed is somewhat complicated, as various things are accomplished
by it besides simply opening and closing the
valve. If an engine has a <i>reverse lever</i>, it works through
the valve gear; and the <i>governor</i> which regulates the
speed of the engine may also operate through the valve
gear. It is therefore very important.</p>

<p>The simplest valve gear depends for its action on a
fixed eccentric.</p>

<p>An <i>eccentric</i> consists of a central disc called the
<i>sheave</i>, keyed to the main shaft at a point to one side of
its true center, and a grooved ring or <i>strap</i> surrounding
it and sliding loosely around it. The strap is usually
made of brass or some anti-friction metal. It is in two
parts, which are bolted together so that they can be tightened
up as the strap wears.</p>

<p>The <i>eccentric rod</i> is either bolted to the strap or forms
a single piece with it, and this rod transmits its motion to
the valve.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the eccentric is nothing
more than a sort of disc crank, which, however, does not
need to be attached to the end of a shaft in the manner
of an ordinary crank.</p>

<p>The distance between the center of the eccentric sheave
and the center of the shaft is called the <i>throw</i> of the eccentric
or the <i>eccentricity</i>.</p>

<p>The eccentric usually conveys its force through a connecting
rod to the valve stem, which moves the valve.</p>
<a id="Page_37" href="#Page_37" class="pagenum" title="37"> </a>

<p>The first modification of the simple eccentric valve
gear is</p>


<h3>THE REVERSING GEAR.</h3>

<p>It is very desirable to control the movement of the
steam valve, so that if desired the engine may be run in
the opposite direction; or the steam force may be brought
to bear to stop the engine quickly; or the travel of the
valve regulated so that it will let into the cylinder only
as much steam as is needed to run the engine when the
load is light and the steam pressure in the boiler high.</p>

<p>There is a great variety of reversing gears; but we
will consider one of the commonest and simplest first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_037">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="550" height="407" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HUBER SINGLE ECCENTRIC REVERSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If the eccentric sheave could be slipped around on the
shaft to a position opposite to that in which it was keyed
to shaft in its ordinary motion, the motion of the valve
would be reversed, and it would let steam in front of the
advancing end of the piston, which would check its
movement, and start it in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The <i>link gear</i>, invented by Stephenson, accomplishes
this in a natural and easy manner. There are two eccentrics
placed just opposite to each other on the crank
shaft, their connecting rods terminating in what is called
a <i>link</i>, through which motion is communicated to the valve
stem. The link is a curved slide, one eccentric being connected
to one end, the other eccentric to the other end,
<a id="Page_38" href="#Page_38" class="pagenum" title="38"> </a>
and the <i>link-block</i>, through which motion is conveyed to
the valve, slides freely from one end to the other. Lower
the link so that the block is opposite the end of the first
rod, and the valve will be moved by the corresponding
eccentric; raise the
link, so that the
block is opposite
the end of the other
rod, and the
valve will be
moved by the other
eccentric. In the
middle there would
be a dead center, and if the block stopped here, the
valve would not move at all. At any intermediate point,
the travel of the valve would be correspondingly shortened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_038">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="550" height="449" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>VALVE AND LINK REVERSE.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_39" href="#Page_39" class="pagenum" title="39"> </a>

<p>Such is the theoretical effect of a perfect link; but the
dead center is not absolute, and the motion of the link is
varied by the point at which the rod is attached which
lifts and lowers it, and also by the length of this rod.
In full gear the block
is not allowed to come
quite to the end of the
link, and this surplus
distance is called the
<i>clearance</i>. The <i>radius</i>
of a link is the distance
from the center
of the driving shaft
to the center of the
link, and the curve of
the link is that of a
circle with that radius.
The length of the
radius may vary considerably,
but the
point of suspension is
important. If a link
is suspended by its
center, it will certainly
cut off steam
sooner in the front
stroke than in the
back. Usually it is
suspended from that
point which is most
used in running the
engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_039">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="600" height="239" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE WOOLF REVERSE VALVE GEAR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Woolf reversing
gear</i> employs but
one eccentric, to the
strap of which is cast
an arm having a block
pivoted at its end.
This block slides in a
pivoted guide, the angle
of which is controlled
<a id="Page_40" href="#Page_40" class="pagenum" title="40"> </a>
by the reverse lever. To the eccentric arm is attached
the eccentric rod, which transmits the motion to
the valve rod through a rocker arm on simple engines
and through a slide, as shown in cut, on compound engines.</p>

<p><i>The Meyer valve gear</i> does not actually reverse an
engine, but controls the admission of steam by means
of an additional valve riding on the back of the main
valve and controlling the cut-off. The main valve is like
an ordinary D-valve, except that the steam is not admitted
around the ends, but through ports running
through the valve, these ports being partially opened or
closed by the motion of
the riding valve, which is
controlled by a separate
eccentric. If this riding
valve is connected with a
governor, it will regulate
the speed of an engine;
and by the addition of a
link the gear may be
made reversible. The
chief objection to it is
the excessive friction
of the valves on their
seats.</p>


<h3>GOVERNORS.</h3>

<p>A governor is a mechanism
by which the supply
of steam to the cylinder
is regulated by revolving balls, or the like, which
runs faster or slower as the speed of the engine increases
or diminishes. Thus the speed of an engine is regulated
to varying loads and conditions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_040">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="326" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SECTIONAL VIEW SHOWING VALVE
OF WATERS GOVERNOR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The simplest type of governor, and the one commonly
used on traction engines, is that which is only a modification
of the one invented by Watt. Two balls revolve
around a spindle in such a way as to rise when the speed
of the engine is high, and fall when it is low, and in rising
<a id="Page_41" href="#Page_41" class="pagenum" title="41"> </a>
and falling they open and close a valve similar to the
throttle valve. The amount that the governor valve is
opened or closed by the rise and fall of the governor
balls is usually regulated by a thumb screw at the top or
side, or by what is called a handle nut, which is usually
held firm by a check nut directly over it, which should be
screwed firm against the handle nut.
Motion is conveyed to the governor
balls by a belt and a band wheel working
on a mechanism of metred cogs.</p>

<p>There is considerable friction about
a governor of this type and much energy
is wasted in keeping it going.
The valve stem or spindle passes
through a steam-tight stuffing box,
where it is liable to stick if the packing
is too tight; and if this stuffing
box leaks steam, there will be immediate
loss of power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_041">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="173" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PICKERING HORIZONTAL
GOVERNOR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Such a governor as has just been
described is called a throttle valve
governor. On high grade engines the
difficulties inherent in this type of
governor are overcome by making the
governor control, not a valve in the
steam supply pipe, but the admission
of steam to the steam cylinder through the steam valve
and its gear. Such engines are described as having an
“automatic cut-off.” Sometimes the governor is attached
to the link, sometimes to a separate valve, as in
the Meyer gear already described. Usually the governor
is attached to the fly-wheel, and consequently governors
of this type are called fly-wheel governors. An automatic
cut-off governor is from 15 per cent to 20 per cent more
effective than a throttle valve governor.</p>


<h3>CRANK, SHAFT AND JOURNALS.</h3>

<p>We have already seen how the piston conveys its power
through the piston rod, the cross-head, and the connecting
rod, to the crank pin and crank, and hence to the
shaft.</p>
<a id="Page_42" href="#Page_42" class="pagenum" title="42"> </a>

<p><i>The key, gib, and strap</i> are the effective means by
which the connecting rod is attached, first to the wrist pin
in the cross-head, and secondly to the crank pin on the
crank.</p>

<p>The <i>strap</i> is usually made of two or three pieces of
wrought iron or steel bolted together so as to hold the
<i>brasses</i>, which are in two parts and loosely surround the
pin. The brasses do not quite meet, and as they wear
may be tightened up. This is effected by the <i>gib</i>, back
of which is the <i>key</i>, which is commonly a wedge which
may be driven in, or a screw, which presses on the back
of the gib, which in turn forces together the brasses; and
thus the length of the piston gear is kept uniform in
spite of the wear, becoming neither shorter nor longer.
When the brasses are so worn that they have been forced
together, they must be taken out and filed equally on
all four of the meeting ends, and shims, or thin pieces of
sheet iron or the like placed back of them to equalize the
wear, and prevent the piston gear from being shortened
or otherwise altered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_042">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="550" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CONNECTING ROD AND BOXES.</p>
<p>(A.&nbsp;W. Stevens Co.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>crank</i> is a simple lever attached to the shaft by
which the shaft is rotated. There are two types of crank
in common use, the side crank, which works by what is
virtually a bend in the shaft. There is also what is
<a id="Page_43" href="#Page_43" class="pagenum" title="43"> </a>
called the disc crank, a variation of the side crank, in
which the power is applied to the circumference of a disc
instead of to the end of a lever arm.</p>

<p>The <i>boss</i> of a crank is that part which surrounds the
shaft and butts against the main bearing, and is usually
about twice the diameter of the crank shaft journal. The
<i>web</i> of the crank is the portion between the shaft and the
pin.</p>

<p>To secure noiseless running, the crank pin should be
turned with great exactness, and should be set exactly
parallel with the direction of the shaft. When the
pressure on the pin or any bearing is over 800 pounds per
square inch, oil is no longer able to lubricate it properly.
Hence the bearing surface should always be large enough
to prevent a greater pressure than 800 pounds to the
square inch. To secure the proper proportions the crank
pin should have a diameter of one-fourth the bore of the
cylinder, and its length should be one-third that of the
cylinder.</p>

<p>The <i>shaft</i> is made of wrought iron or steel, and must
not only be able to withstand the twisting motion of the
crank, but the bending force of the engine stroke. To
prevent bending, the shaft should have a bearing as near
the crank as possible.</p>

<p>The <i>journals</i> are those portions of the shaft which work
in bearings. The main bearings are also called <i>pedestals</i>,
<i>pillow blocks</i>, and <i>journal boxes</i>. They usually consist
of boxes made of brass or some other anti-friction material
carried in iron pedestals. The pillow blocks are
usually adjustable.</p>


<h3>THE FLY-WHEEL.</h3>

<p>This is a heavy wheel attached to the shaft. Its object
is to regulate the variable action of the piston, and to
make the motion uniform even when the load is variable.
By its inertia it stores energy, which would keep the engine
running for some time after the piston ceased to
apply any force or power.</p>


<h3>LUBRICATORS.</h3>

<p>All bearings must be steadily and effectively lubricated,
in order to remove friction as far as possible, or the working
<a id="Page_44" href="#Page_44" class="pagenum" title="44"> </a>
power of the engine will be greatly reduced. Besides,
without complete and effective lubrication, the bearings
will “cut,” or wear in irregular grooves, etc., quickly
ruining the engine.</p>

<p>Bearings are lubricated through automatic lubricator
cups, which hold oil or grease and discharge it uniformly
upon the bearing through a suitable hole.</p>

<p>A sight feed ordinary cup permits the drops of oil to
be seen as they pass downward through a glass tube, and
also the engineer may see how much oil there is in the
cup. Such a cup is suitable for all parts of an engine
except the crank pin, cross-head, and, of course, the
cylinder.</p>

<p>The crank pin oiler is an oil cup so arranged as to force
oil into the bearing only when the engine is working, and
more rapidly as the engine works more rapidly. In one
form, which uses liquid oil, the oil stands below a disc,
from which is the opening through the shank to the
bearing. As the engine speeds up, the centrifugal force
<a id="Page_45" href="#Page_45" class="pagenum" title="45"> </a>
tends to force the oil to the top of the cup and so on to the
bearing, and the higher the speed the greater the amount
of oil thrown into the crank pin.</p>

<p>Hard oil or grease has of late been coming into extensive
use. It is placed in a compression cup, at the top of
which a disc is pressed down by a spring, and also by some
kind of a screw. From time to time the screw is tightened
up by hand, and the spring automatically forces
down the grease.</p>

<p><i>The Cylinder Lubricator</i> is constructed on a different
principle, and uses an entirely different kind of oil, called
“cylinder oil.” A sight-feed automatic oiler is so arranged
that the oil passes through water drop by drop, so
that each drop can be seen behind glass before it passes
into the steam pipe leading from the boiler to the cylinder.
The oil mingles with the steam and passes into the
steam chest, and thence into the cylinder, lubricating the
valve and piston.</p>

<p>The discharge of the oil may not only be watched, but
regulated, and some judgment is necessary to make sure
that enough oil is passing into the cylinder to prevent it
from cutting.</p>

<p>The oil is forced into the steam by the weight of the
<a id="Page_46" href="#Page_46" class="pagenum" title="46"> </a>
column of water, since the steam pressure is the same at
both ends. There is a small cock by which this water of
condensation may be drained off when the engine is shut
down in cold weather. Oilers are also injured by straining
from heating caused by the steam
acting on cold oil when all the cocks
are closed. There is a relief cock to
prevent this strain, and it should be
slightly opened, except when oiler is being
filled.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ACORN OIL PUMP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are a number of different types
of oilers, with their cocks arranged in
different ways; but the manufacturer always
gives diagrams and instructions
fully explaining the working of the oiler.
Oil pumps serving the same purpose are now often used.</p>


<h3>DIFFERENTIAL GEAR.</h3>

<p>The gearing by which the traction wheels of a traction
engine are made to drive the engine is an important item.
Of course, it is desirable to apply the power of the engine
to both traction wheels; yet if both hind wheels were
geared stiff, the engine could not turn from a straight
line, since in turning one wheel must move faster than
the other. The differential or compensating gear is a
device to leave both wheels free to move one ahead of
the other if occasion requires. The principle is much the
same as in case of a rachet on a geared wheel, if power
were applied to the ratchet to make the wheel turn; if
for any reason the wheel had a tendency of its own to
turn faster than the ratchet forced it, it would be free to
do so. When corners are turned the power is applied to
one wheel only, and the other wheel is permitted to move
faster or slower than the wheel to which the gearing
applies the power.</p>

<p>There are several forms of differential gears, differing
largely as to combination of spur or bevel cogs. One of
the best known uses four little beveled pinions, which are
placed in the main driving wheel as shown in the cut.
Beveled cogs work into these on either side of the main
<a id="Page_47" href="#Page_47" class="pagenum" title="47"> </a>
wheel. If one traction wheel moves faster than the other
these pinions move around and adjust the gears on either
side.</p>

<h3>FRICTION CLUTCH.</h3>

<p>The power of an engine is usually applied to the traction
wheel by a friction clutch working on the inside of
the fly-wheel. (See <a href="#i_051" class="int-ref">plan of Frick Engine</a>.) The
traction wheels are the two large, broad-rimmed hind
wheels, and are provided with projections to give them
<a id="Page_48" href="#Page_48" class="pagenum" title="48"> </a>
a firm footing on the road. Traction engines are also
provided with mud shoes and wheel cleaning devices for
mud and snow.</p>

<h3>THE FUSIBLE PLUG.</h3>

<p>The fusible plug is a simple screw plug, the center of
which is bored out and subsequently filled with
some other metal that will melt at a lower temperature
than steel or iron. This plug is placed in the
crown sheet of a locomotive boiler as a precaution for
<a id="Page_49" href="#Page_49" class="pagenum" title="49"> </a>
safety. Should the crown sheet become free of water
when the fire is very hot, the soft metal in the fusible
plug would melt and run out, and the overheated steam
would escape into the firebox, putting out the fire and
giving the boiler relief so that an explosion would be
avoided. In some states a fusible plug is required by
<a id="Page_50" href="#Page_50" class="pagenum" title="50"> </a>
law, and one is found in nearly every boiler which has a
crown sheet. Return flue boilers and others which do
not have crown sheets (as for example the vertical) do
not have fusible plugs. To be of value a fusible plug
should be renewed or changed once a month.</p>


<h3>STUFFING BOXES.</h3>

<p>Any arrangement to make a steam-tight joint about a
moving rod, such as a piston rod or steam valve rod,
would be called a stuffing box. Usually the stuffing box
gives free play to a piston rod or valve rod, without allowing
any steam to escape. A stuffing box is also
used on a pump piston sometimes, or a compressed air
piston. In all these cases it consists of an annular space
around the moving rod which can be partly filled by some
pliable elastic material such as hemp, cotton, rubber, or
the like; and this filling is held in place and made tighter
or looser by what is called a gland, which is forced into
the partly filled box by screwing up a cap on the outside
of the cylinder. Stuffing boxes must be repacked occasionally,
since the packing material will get hard and
dead, and will either leak steam or cut the rod.</p>


<h3>CYLINDER COCKS.</h3>

<p>These cocks are for the purpose of drawing the water
formed by condensation of steam out of the cylinder.
They should be opened whenever the engine is stopped or
started, and should be left open when the engine is shut
down, especially in cold weather to prevent freezing of
water and consequent damage. Attention to these cocks
is very important.</p>

<p>These are small cocks arranged about the pump and at
other places for the purpose of testing the inside action.
By them it is possible to see if the pump is working properly,
etc.</p>


<h3>STEAM INDICATOR.</h3>

<p>The steam indicator is an instrument that can be attached
to either end of a steam cylinder, and will indicate
the character of the steam pressure during the entire
<a id="Page_51" href="#Page_51" class="pagenum" title="51"> </a>
stroke of the piston. It shows clearly whether the lead is
right, how much cushion there is, etc. It is very important
in studying the economical use and distribution of
steam, expansive force of steam, etc.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV" href="#toc">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />

<span class="chapter-title">HOW TO MANAGE A TRACTION ENGINE BOILER.</span></h2>


<p>We will suppose that the young engineer fully understands
all parts of the boiler and engine, as explained in
the preceding chapters. It is well to run over the questions
several times, to make sure that every point has
been fully covered and is well understood.</p>

<p>We will suppose that you have an engine in good running
order. If you have a new engine and it starts off
nice and easy (the lone engine without load) with twenty
pounds steam pressure in the boiler, you may make up
your mind that you have a good engine to handle and
one that will give but little trouble. But if it requires fifty
or sixty pounds to start it, you want to keep your eyes
open, for something is tight. But don’t begin taking the
engine to pieces, for you might get more pieces than you
know what to do with. Oil every bearing fully, and then
start your engine and let it run for a while. Then notice
whether you find anything getting warm. If you do, stop
and loosen up a very little and start again. If the heating
still continues, loosen again as before. But remember,
loosen but little at a time, for a box or journal will
heat from being too loose as quickly as from being too
tight, and if you have found a warm box, don’t let that
box take all your attention, but keep your eye on the
other bearings.</p>

<p>In the case of a new engine, the cylinder rings may be
a little tight, and so more steam pressure will be required
to start the engine; but this is no fault, for in a day or two
they will be working all right if kept well oiled.</p>

<p>In starting a new engine trouble sometimes comes from
the presence of a coal cinder in some of the boxes, which
has worked in during shipment. Before starting a new
engine, the boxes and oil holes should therefore be thoroughly
<a id="Page_57" href="#Page_57" class="pagenum" title="57"> </a>
cleaned out. For this purpose the engineer
should always have some cotton waste or an oiled rag
ready for constant use.</p>

<p>A new engine should be run slowly and carefully until
it is found to be in perfect running order.</p>

<p>If you are beginning on an old engine in good running
order, the above instructions will not be needed; but it is
well to take note of them.</p>

<p>Now if your engine is all right, you may run the pressure
up to the point of blowing off, which is 100 to 130
pounds, at which most safety valves are set at the factory.
It is not uncommon for a new pop to stick, and as
the steam runs up it is well to try it by pulling the relief
lever. If on letting it go it stops the escaping steam at
once, it is all right. If, however, the steam continues to
escape the valve sticks in the chamber. Usually a slight
tap with a wrench or hammer will stop it at once; but don’t
get excited if the steam continues to escape. As long as
you have plenty of water in the boiler, and know that you
have it, you are all right.</p>


<h3>STARTING UP A BOILER.</h3>

<p>Almost the only danger from explosion of a boiler is
from not having sufficient water in the boiler. The boiler
is filled in the first place, as has already been explained,
by hand through a funnel at the filler plug, or by a force
pump. The water should stand an inch and a half in the
glass of the water gauge before the fire is started. It
should be heated up slowly so as not to strain the boiler or
connections. When the steam pressure as shown by the
steam gauge is ten or fifteen pounds, the blower may be
used to increase the draft.</p>

<p>If you let the water get above the top of the glass, you
are liable to knock out a cylinder head; and if you let the
water get below the bottom of the glass, you are likely to
explode your boiler.</p>

<p>The glass gauge is not to be depended upon, however,
for a number of things may happen to interfere with its
working. Some one may inadvertently turn off the gauge
cocks, and though the water stands at the proper height
in the glass, the water in the boiler will be very different.</p>
<a id="Page_58" href="#Page_58" class="pagenum" title="58"> </a>

<p>A properly made boiler is supplied with two to four try-cocks,
one below the proper water line, and one above it.
If there are more than two they will be distributed at suitable
points between.</p>

<p>When the boiler is under pressure, turn on the lower
try-cock and you should get water. You will know it
because it will appear as white mist. Then try the upper
try-cock, and you will get steam, which will appear blue.</p>

<p>NEVER FAIL TO USE THE TRY-COCKS FREQUENTLY.
This is necessary not only because you
never know when the glass is deceiving you; but if you
fail to use them they will get stopped up with lime or mud,
and when you need to use them they will not work.</p>

<p>In order also to keep the water gauge in proper condition,
it should be frequently blown out in the following
manner: Shut off the top gauge cock and open the drain
cock at the bottom of the gauge. This allows the water
and steam to blow through the lower cock of the water
gauge, and you know that it is open. Any lime or mud
that has begun to accumulate will also be carried off. After
allowing the steam to escape a few seconds, shut off
the lower gauge cock, and open the upper one, and allow it
to blow off about the same time. Then shut the drain cock
and open both gauge cocks, when you will see the water
seek its level, and you can feel assured that it is reliable
and in good working condition. This little operation you
should perform every day you run your engine. If you
do you will not <i>think</i> you have sufficient water in the
boiler, but will <i>know</i>. The engineer who always <i>knows</i>
he has water in the boiler will not be likely to have an explosion.
Especially should you never start your fire in
the morning simply because you see water in the gauge.
You should <i>know</i> that there is water in the boiler.</p>

<p>Now if your pump and boiler are in good working condition,
and you leave the globe valve in the supply pipe
to the pump open, with the hose in the tank, you will probably
come to your engine in the morning and find the
boiler nearly full of water, and you will think some one
has been tampering with the engine. The truth is, however,
that as the steam condensed, a vacuum was formed,
and the water flowed in on account of atmospheric pressure,
<a id="Page_59" href="#Page_59" class="pagenum" title="59"> </a>
just as it flows into a suction pump when the plunger
rises and creates a vacuum in the pump. Check valves
are arranged to prevent anything passing out of the boiler,
but there is nothing to prevent water passing in.</p>

<p>The only other cause of an explosion, beside poor material
in the manufacture of the boiler, is too high steam
pressure, due to a defective safety valve or imperfect
steam<!--TN: was 'team'--> gauge. The steam gauge is likely to get out of
order in a number of ways, and so is the safety valve. To
make sure that both are all right, the one should frequently
be tested by the other. The lever of the safety valve
should frequently be tried from time to time, to make sure
the valve opens and closes easily, and whenever the safety
valve blows off, the steam gauge should be noted to see
if it indicates the pressure at which the safety has been
set.</p>


<h3>WHEN YOUR ENGINE IS ALL RIGHT, LET IT ALONE.</h3>

<p>Some engineers are always loosening a nut here, tightening<!--TN: was 'tightning'-->
up a box there, adjusting this, altering that. When
an engine is all right they keep at it till it is all wrong.
As a result they are in trouble most of the time. When
an engine is running all right, LET IT ALONE. Don’t
think you are not earning your salary because you are
merely sitting still and looking on. If you must be at
work, keep at it with an oily rag, cleaning and polishing
up. That is the way to find out if anything is really the
matter. As the practised hand of the skilled engineer
goes over an engine, his ears wide open for any peculiarity
of sound, anything that is not as it should be will make
itself decidedly apparent. On the other hand, an engineer
who does not keep his engine clean and bright by
constantly passing his hand over it with an oily rag, is
certain to overlook something, which perhaps in the end
will cost the owner a good many dollars to put right.</p>

<p>Says an old engineer<a id="Marker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="marker" title="Footnote 3">3</a> we know, “When I see an engineer
watching his engine closely while running, I am
most certain to see another commendable feature in a
<a id="Page_60" href="#Page_60" class="pagenum" title="60"> </a>
good engineer, and that is, when he stops his engine he
will pick up a greasy rag and go over his engine carefully,
wiping every working part, watching or looking carefully
at every point that he touches. If a nut is working
loose, he finds it; if a bearing is hot, he finds it; if any part
of his engine has been cutting, he finds it. He picks up a
greasy rag instead of a wrench, for the engineer that understands
his business and attends to it never picks up a
wrench unless he has something to do with it.”</p>

<p>This same engineer goes on with some more most excellent
advice. Says he:</p>

<p>“Now, if your engine runs irregularly, that is, if it
runs up to a higher speed than you want, and then runs
down, you are likely to say at once, ‘Oh, I know what the
trouble is, it is the governor.’ Well, suppose it is. What
are you going to do about it? Are you going to shut
down at once and go to tinkering with it? No, don’t do
that. Stay close to the throttle valve and watch the
governor closely. Keep your eye on the governor stem,
and when the engine starts off on one of its speed tilts,
you will see the stem go down through the stuffing box
and then stop and stick in one place until the engine slows
down below its regular speed, and it then lets loose and
goes up quickly and your engine lopes off again. You
have now located the trouble. It is in the stuffing box
around the little brass rod or governor stem. The packing
has become dry and by loosening it up and applying
oil you may remedy the trouble until such time as you
can repack it with fresh packing. Candle wick is as good
for this purpose as anything you can use.</p>

<p>“But if the governor does not act as I have described,
and the stem seems to be perfectly free and easy in the
box, and the governor still acts queerly, starting off and
running fast for a few seconds and then suddenly concluding
to take it easy and away goes the engine again,
see if the governor belt is all right, and if it is it would be
well for you to stop and see if a wheel is not loose. It
might be either the little belt wheel or one of the little
cog wheels. If you find these are all right, examine the
spool on the crank shaft from which the governor is run,
<a id="Page_61" href="#Page_61" class="pagenum" title="61"> </a>
and you will probably find it loose. If the engine has been
run for any length of time, you will always find the
trouble in one of these places; but if it is a new one, the
governor valve might work a little tight in the valve chamber,
and you may have to take it out and use a little emery
paper to take off the rough projections on the valve.
Never use a file on this valve if you can get emery paper,
and I should advise you always to have some of it with
you. It will often come handy.”</p>

<p>This is good advice in regard to any trouble you may
have with an engine. Watch the affected part closely;
think the matter over carefully, and see if you cannot locate
the difficulty before you even stop your engine. If
you find the trouble and know that you have found it,
you will soon be able to correct the defect, and no time will
be lost. At the same time you will not ruin your engine
by trying all sorts of remedies at random in the thought
that you may ultimately hit the right thing. The chances
are that before you do hit the right point, you will have
put half a dozen other matters wrong, and it will take half
a day to get the matter right again.</p>

<p>As there are many different types of governors in use,
it would be impossible to give exact directions for regulating
that would apply to them all; but the following suggestions
applying to the Waters governor (one widely
used on threshing engines) will give a general idea of the
method for all:</p>

<p>There are two little brass nuts on the top of the stem of
the governor, one a thumb nut and the other a loose jam
nut. To increase the speed, loosen the jam nut and then
turn the thumb nut back slowly, watching the motion of
the engine all the time. When the required speed has
been obtained, then tighten up as snug as you can with
your fingers (not using a wrench). To decrease the speed,
loosen the jam nut as before, running it up a few turns,
and then turn down the thumb nut till the speed meets
your requirements, when the thumb nut is made fast as
before. In any case, be very careful not to press down on
the stem when turning the thumb nut, as this will make
<a id="Page_62" href="#Page_62" class="pagenum" title="62"> </a>
the engine run a little slower than will be the case when
your hand has been removed.</p>

<p>If your engine does not start with an open throttle, look
to see if the governor stem has not been screwed down
tight. This is usually the case with a new engine, which
has been screwed down for safety in transportation.</p>


<h3>WATER FOR THE BOILER.</h3>

<p>There is nothing that needs such constant watching and
is likely to cause so much trouble if it is not cared for, as
the supply of water. Hard well water will coat the inside
of the boiler with lime and soon reduce its steaming
power in a serious degree, to say nothing of stopping up
pipes, cocks, etc. At the same time, rain water that is
perfectly pure (theoretically) will be found to have a little
acid or alkali in it that will eat through the iron or steel
and do equal damage.</p>

<p>However, an engineer must use what water he can. He
cannot have it made to order for him, but he must take it
from well, from brook, or cistern, or roadside ditch, as
circumstances may require. The problem for the engineer
is not to get the best water, but to make the best use
of whatever water he can get, always, of course, choosing
the best and purest when there is such a thing as choosing.</p>

<p>In the first place, all supply pipes in water that is
muddy or likely to have sticks, leaves, or the like in it,
should be furnished with strainers. If sticks or leaves get
into the valve, the expense in time and worry to get them
out will be ten times the cost of a strainer.</p>

<p>If the water is rain water, and the boiler is a new one,
it would be well to put in a little lime to give the iron a
slight coating that will protect it from any acid or alkali
corrosion.</p>

<p>If the water is hard, some compound or sal ammonia
should be used. No specific directions can be given, since
water is made hard by having different substances dissolved
in it, and the right compound or chemical is that
which is adapted to the particular substance you are to
counteract. An old engineer says his advice is to use no
<a id="Page_63" href="#Page_63" class="pagenum" title="63"> </a>
compound at all, but to put a hatful of potatoes in the
boiler every morning.</p>

<p>Occasionally using rain water for a day or two previous
to cleaning is one of the best things in the world to remove
and throw down all scale. It beats compounds at
every point. It is nature’s remedy for the bad effects of
hard water.</p>

<p>The important thing, however, is to clean the boiler
thoroughly and often. In no case should the lime be allowed
to bake on the iron. If it gets thick, the iron or
steel is sure to burn, and the lime to bake so hard it will be
almost impossible to get it off. But if the boiler is cleaned
often, such a thing will not happen.</p>

<p>Mud or sediment can be blown off by opening the valve
from the mud drum or the firebox at the bottom of the
boiler when the pressure is not over 15 or 20 pounds; and
at this pressure much of the lime distributed about the
boiler may be blown off. But this is not enough. The
inside of the boiler should be scraped and thoroughly
washed out with a hose and force-pump just as often as
the condition of the water requires it.</p>

<p>In cleaning the boiler, always be careful to scrape all
the lime off the top of the fusible plug.</p>


<h3>THE PUMP.</h3>

<p>In order to manage the pump successfully, the young
engineer must understand thoroughly its construction as
already described. It is also necessary to understand
something of the theory of atmospheric pressure, lifting
power, and forcing power.</p>

<p>First see that the cocks or globe valves (whichever are
used) are open both between the boiler and the pump and
between the pump and the water supply. The globe
valve next the boiler should <i>never</i> be closed, except when
examining the boiler check valve. Then open the little
pet cock between the two upper horizontal check valves.
Be sure that the check valves are in good order, so that
water can pass only in one direction. A clear, sharp
click of the check valves is certain evidence that the pump
is working well. If you cannot hear the click, take a stick
<a id="Page_64" href="#Page_64" class="pagenum" title="64"> </a>
or pencil between your teeth at one end, put the other end
on the valve, stuff your fingers in your ears, and you will
hear the movement of the valve as plainly as if it were a
sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>The small drain cock between the horizontal check
valves is used to drain hot water out of the pump in starting,
for a pump will never work well with hot water in
it; and to drain off all water in closing down in cold
weather, to prevent damage from freezing. It also assists
in testing the working of the pump. In starting up it
may be left open. If water flows from the drain cock, we
know the pump is working all right, and then close the
drain cock. If you are at any time in doubt as to whether
water is going into the boiler properly, you may open this
drain cock and see if cold water flows freely. If it does,
everything is working as it should. If hot water appears,
you may know something is wrong. Also, to test the
pump, place your hand on the two check valves, and if
they are cold, the pump is all right; if they are hot, something
is wrong, since the heat must come from the boiler,
and no hot water or steam should ever be allowed to pass
from the boiler back to the pump.</p>

<p>A stop cock next the boiler is decidedly preferable to a
globe valve, since you can tell if it is open by simply
looking at it; whereas you must put your hand on a globe
valve and turn it. Trouble often arises through inadvertently
closing the valve or cock next the boiler, in which
case, of course, no water can pass into the boiler, and the
pump is likely to be ruined, since the water must get out
somewhere. Some part of the pump would be sure to
burst if worked against a closed boiler cock or valve.</p>

<p>Should the pump suddenly cease to work or stop, first
see if you have any water in the tank. If there is water,
stoppage may be due to air in the pump chamber, which
can get in only through the stuffing-box. If this is true,
tighten up the pump plunger stuffing-box nut a little. If
now the pump starts off well, you have found the difficulty;
but at the first opportunity you ought to repack the
stuffing-box.</p>

<p>If the stuffing-box is all right, examine the supply suction
<a id="Page_65" href="#Page_65" class="pagenum" title="65"> </a>
hose. See that nothing is clogging the strainer, and
ascertain whether the water is sucked in or not. If it is
sucked in and then is forced out again (which you can
ascertain by holding your hand lightly over the suction
pipe), you may know something is the matter with the
first check valve. Probably a stick or stone has gotten
into it and prevents it from shutting down.</p>

<p>If there is no suction, examine the second check valve.
If there is something under it that prevents its closing, the
water will flow back into the pump chamber again as
soon as the plunger is drawn back.</p>

<p>You can always tell whether the trouble is in the second
check or in the hot water check valve by opening the
little drain cock. If hot water flows from it, you may
know that the hot water check valve is out of order; if
only cold water flows, you may be pretty sure the hot
water check is all right. If there is any reason to suspect
the hot water check valve, close the stop cock or valve
next the boiler before you touch the check in any way.
To tamper with the hot water check while the
steam pressure is upon it would be highly dangerous, for
you are liable to get badly burned with escaping steam
or hot water. At the same time, be very sure the stop
cock or valve next the boiler is open again before you
start the pump.</p>

<p>Another reason for check valves refusing to work besides
having something under them, is that the valve may
stick in the valve chamber because of a rough place in the
chamber, or a little projection on the valve. Light tapping
with a wrench may remedy the matter. If that does
not work, try the following plan suggested by an old
engineer<a id="Marker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="marker" title="Footnote 4">4</a>: “Take the valve out, bore a hole in a board
about one-half inch deep, and large enough to permit the
valve to be turned. Drop a little emery dust in this hole.
If you haven’t any emery dust, scrape some grit from a
whetstone. If you have no whetstone, put some fine sand
or gritty soil in the hole, put the valve on top of it, put
your brace on the valve and turn it vigorously for a few
minutes, and you will remove all roughness.”</p>

<a id="Page_66" href="#Page_66" class="pagenum" title="66"> </a>

<p>Sometimes the burr on the valve comes from long use;
but the above treatment will make it as good as new.</p>


<h3>INJECTORS.</h3>

<p>All injectors are greatly affected by conditions, such as
the lift, the steam pressure, the temperature of the water,
etc. An injector will not use hot water well, if at all.
As the lift is greater, the steam pressure required to start
is greater, and at the same time the highest steam pressure
under which the injector will work at all is greatly
decreased. The same applies to the lifting of warm
water: the higher the temperature, the greater the steam
pressure required to start, and the less the steam pressure
which can be used as a maximum.</p>

<p>It is important for the sake of economy to use the right
sized injector. Before buying a new injector, find out
first how much water you need for your boiler, and then
buy an injector of about the capacity required, though of
course an injector must always have a maximum capacity
in excess of what will be required.</p>

<p>If the feed water is cold, a good injector ought to start
with 25 pounds steam pressure and work up to 150
pounds for a 2-foot lift. If the lift is eight feet, it will
start at 30 pounds and work up to 130. If the water is
heated to 100 degrees Fahrenheit it will start for a 2-foot
lift with 26 pounds and work up to 120 pounds, or for an
8-foot lift, it will start with 33 pounds and work up to
100. These figures apply to the single tube injector. The
double tube injector should work from 14 pounds to 250,
and from 15 to 210 under same conditions as above. The
double tube injector is not commonly used on farm engines,
however.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the injector is not so near the
boiler as to become heated, else it will not work. If it
gets too hot, it must be cooled by pouring cold water on
the outside, first having covered it with a cloth to hold the
water. If the injector is cool, and the steam pressure and
lift are all right, and still the injector does not work, you
may be sure there is some obstruction somewhere. Shut
off the steam from the boiler, and run a fine wire down
<a id="Page_67" href="#Page_67" class="pagenum" title="67"> </a>
through the cone valve or cylinder valve, after having
removed the cap or plug nut.</p>

<p>Starting an injector always requires some skill, and injectors
differ. Some start by manipulating the steam
valve; some require that the steam be turned on first, and
then the water turned on in just the right amount, usually
with a quick short twist of the supply valve. Often some
patience is required to get just the right turn on it so that
it will start.</p>

<p>Of course you must be sure that all joints are air-tight,
else the injector will not work under any conditions.</p>

<p>Never use an injector where a pump can be used, as
the injector is much more wasteful of steam. It is for an
emergency or to throw water in a boiler when engine is
not running.</p>

<p>No lubricator is needed on an injector.</p>


<h3>THE HEATER.</h3>

<p>The construction of the heater has already been explained.
It has two check valves, one on the side of the
pump and one on the side of the boiler, both opening
toward the boiler. The exhaust steam is usually at a
temperature of 215 to 220 degrees when it enters the heater
chamber, and heats the water nearly or quite to boiling
point as it passes through. The injector heats the water
almost as hot.</p>

<p>The heater requires little attention, and the check valves
seldom get out of order.</p>

<p>The pump is to be used when the engine is running,
and the injector when the engine is closed down. The
pump is the more economical; but when the engine is not
working the exhaust steam is not sufficient to heat the
water in the heater; and pumping cold water into the
boiler will quickly bring down the pressure and injure the
boiler.</p>


<h3>ECONOMICAL FIRING.</h3>

<p>The management of the fire is one of the most important
things in running a steam engine. On it depend
two things of the greatest consequence—success in getting
up steam quickly and keeping it at a steady pressure under
<a id="Page_68" href="#Page_68" class="pagenum" title="68"> </a>
all conditions; and economy in the use of fuel. An
engineer who understands firing in the most economical
way will probably save his wages to his employer over
the engineer who is indifferent or unscientific about it.
Therefore the young engineer should give the subject
great attention.</p>

<p>First, let us consider firing with coal. All expert engineers
advise a “thin” fire. This means that you should
have a thin bed of coals, say about four inches thick, all
over the grate. There should be no holes or dead places
in this, for if there are any, cold air will short-circuit into
the fire flues and cool off the boiler.</p>

<p>The best way of firing is to spread the coal on with a
small hand shovel, a very little at a time, scattering it well
over the fire. Another way, recommended by some, is
to have a small pile of fresh fuel at the front of the grate,
pushing it back over the grate when it is well lighted. To
manage this well will require some practice and skill, and
for a beginner, we recommend scattering small shovelsful
all over the fire. All lump coal should be broken to a
uniform size. No piece larger than a man’s fist should
be put in a firebox.</p>

<p>Seldom use the poker above the fire, for nothing has
such a tendency to put out a coal fire as stirring it with a
poker above. And when there is a good glow all over the
grate below, the poker is not needed below. When the
grate becomes covered with dead ashes, they should be
cautiously but fully removed, and clinkers must be lifted
out with the poker from above, care being exercised to
cover up the holes with live coals.</p>

<p>Hard coal if used should be dampened before being put
on the fire.</p>

<p>When the fire is burning a little too briskly, close the
draft but do not tamper with the fire itself. Should it
become important on a sudden emergency to check the
fire at any time quickly, never dash water upon it, but
rather throw plenty of fresh fuel upon it. Fresh fuel always
lowers the heat at first. If all drafts are closed
tight, it will lower the heat considerably for quite a time.</p>

<p>In checking a fire, it must be remembered that very
<a id="Page_69" href="#Page_69" class="pagenum" title="69"> </a>
sudden cooling will almost surely crack the boiler. If
there is danger of an explosion it may be necessary to
draw the fire out entirely; but under no circumstances
should cold water be thrown on. After drawing the fire
close all doors and dampers.</p>


<h3>FIRING WITH WOOD.</h3>

<p>Always keep the fire door shut as much as possible, as
cold air thus admitted will check the fire and ruin the
boiler.</p>

<p>Firing with wood is in many ways the exact reverse of
firing with coal. The firebox should be filled full of
wood at all times. The wood should be thrown in in
every direction, in pieces of moderate size, and as it burns
away, fresh pieces should be put in at the front so that
they will get lighted and ready to burn before being
pushed back near the boiler. It often helps a wood fire,
too, to stir it with a poker. Wood makes much less ash
than coal, and what little accumulates in the grate will
not do much harm. Sometimes green wood will not burn
because it gets too much cold air. In that case the sticks
should be packed as close together as possible, still leaving
a place for the air to pass. Also a wood fire, especially
one with green wood, should be kept up to a high
temperature all the time; for if it is allowed to drop down
the wood will suddenly cease to burn at all.</p>


<h3>FIRING WITH STRAW.</h3>

<p>In firing with straw it is important to keep the shute full
of straw all the time so that no cold air can get in on top
of the fire. Don’t push the straw in too fast, either, but
keep it moving at a uniform rate, with small forkfulls.
Now and then it is well to turn the fork over and run it
down into the fire to keep the fire level. Ashes may be
allowed to fill up in rear of ash box, but fifteen inches
should be kept clear in front to provide draft. The brick
arch may be watched from the side opening in the firebox,
and should show a continuous stream of white flame
coming over it. If too much straw is forced in, that will
check the flame. The flame should never be checked. If
<a id="Page_70" href="#Page_70" class="pagenum" title="70"> </a>
damp straw gets against the ends of the flues, it should be
scraped off with the poker from side door. Clean the
tubes well once a day. The draft must always be kept
strong enough to produce a white heat, and if this cannot
be done otherwise, a smaller nozzle may be used on the
exhaust pipe; but this should be avoided when possible,
since it causes back pressure on the engine. Never let the
front end of the boiler stand on low ground. Engine
should be level, or front end high, if it has a firebox locomotive
boiler; if a return flue boiler, be careful to keep
it always level. In burning straw take particular notice
that the spark screen in stack does not get filled up.</p>


<h3>THE ASH PIT.</h3>

<p>In burning coal it is exceedingly important that the
ashes be kept cleaned out, as the hot cinders falling
down on the heap of ashes almost as high as the grate will
overheat the grate in a very short time and warp it all out
of shape, so ruining it.</p>

<p>With wood and straw, on the contrary, an accumulation
of ashes will often help and will seldom do any harm, because
no very hot cinders can drop down below the grates,
and the hottest part of the fire is some distance above the
grates.</p>


<h3>STARTING A FIRE.</h3>

<p>You must make up your mind that it will take half an
hour to an hour or so to get up steam in any boiler that is
perfectly cold. The metal expands and shrinks a great
deal with the heat and cold, and a sudden application of
heat would ruin a boiler in a short time. Hence it is
necessary for reasons of engine economy to make changes
of temperature, either cooling off or heating up, gradually.</p>

<p>First see that there is water in the boiler.</p>

<p>Start a brisk fire with pine kindlings, gradually putting
on coal or wood, as the case may be, and spreading the
fire over the grate so that all parts will be covered with
glowing coals.</p>

<p>When you have 15 or 20 pounds of steam, start the
<a id="Page_71" href="#Page_71" class="pagenum" title="71"> </a>
blower. As has already been described, the blower is a
pipe with a nozzle leading from the steam space of the
boiler to the smoke stack, and fitted with a globe valve.
The force of the steam drives the air out of the stack,
causing a vacuum, which is immediately filled by the hot
gases from the firebox coming through the boiler tubes.
Little is to be gained by using the blower with less than 15
pounds of steam, as the blower has so little strength below
that, that it draws off about as much steam as is made
and nothing is gained.</p>

<p>The blower is seldom needed when the engine is working,
as the exhaust steam should be sufficient to keep the
fire going briskly. If it is not, you should conclude that
something is the matter. There are times, however, when
the blower is required even when the engine is going. For
example, if you are working with very light load and
small use of steam, the exhaust may be insufficient to keep
up the fire; and this will be especially true if the fuel is
very poor. In such a case, turn on the blower very slightly.
But remember that you are wasting steam if you can
get along without the blower.</p>

<p>Examine the nozzle of the blower now and then to see
that it does not become limed up, or turned so as to direct
the steam to one side of the stack, where its force would
be wasted.</p>

<p>Beware, also, of creating too much draft; for too much
draft will use up fuel and make little steam.</p>


<h3>SMOKE.</h3>

<p>Coal smoke is nothing more or less than unburned carbon.
The more smoke you get, the less will be the heat
from a given amount of fuel. Great clouds of black
smoke from an engine all the time are a very bad sign
in an engineer. They show that he does not know how to
fire. He has not followed the directions already given, to
have a thin, hot fire, with few ashes under his grate. Instead,
he throws on great shovelsful of coal at a time,
and has the coal up to the firebox door. His fuel is always
making smoke, which soon clogs up the smoke flues
and lessens the amount of steam he is getting. If he had
<a id="Page_72" href="#Page_72" class="pagenum" title="72"> </a>
kept his fire very “thin,” but very hot, throwing on a
small hand shovel of coal at a time, seldom poking his
fire except to lift out clinkers or clean away dead ashes
under the grate, and keeping his ashpit free from ashes,
there would be only a little puff of black smoke when the
fresh coal went on, and then the smoke would quickly
disappear, while the fire flues would burn clean and not
get clogged up with soot.</p>

<p>It is important, however, to keep the small fire flues especially
well cleaned out with a good flue cleaner; for all
accumulation of soot prevents the heat from passing
through the steel, and so reduces the heating capacity of
the boiler. Cleaning the tubes with a steam blower is
never advisable, as it forms a paste on the tube that greatly
impairs its commodity.</p>


<h3>SPARKS.</h3>

<p>With coal there is little danger of fires caused by sparks
from the engine. What sparks there are are heavy and
dead, and will even fall on a pile of straw without setting
it on fire. On a very windy day, however, when you are
running your engine very hard, especially if it is of the
direct locomotive boiler type, you want to be careful even
with coal.</p>

<p>With wood it is very different; and likewise with straw.
Wood and straw sparks are always dangerous, and an engine
should never be run for threshing with wood or
straw without using a spark-arrester.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that when coal is used it will give
out, and you will be asked to finish your job with wood.
In such a case, it is the duty of an engineer to state fully
and frankly the danger of firing with wood without a
spark arrester, and he should go on only when ordered to
do so by the proprietor, after he has been fully warned.
In that case all responsibility is shifted from the engineer
to the owner.</p>


<h3>THE FUSIBLE PLUG.</h3>

<p>The careful engineer will never have occasion to do
anything to the fusible plug except to clean the scale off
<a id="Page_73" href="#Page_73" class="pagenum" title="73"> </a>
from the top of it on the inside of the boiler once a week,
and put in a fresh plug once a month. It is put in merely
as a precaution to provide for carelessness. The engineer
who allows the fusible plug to melt out is by that very fact
marked as a careless man, and ought to find it so much
the harder to get a job.</p>

<p>As has already been explained, the fusible plug is a plug
filled in the middle with some metal that will melt at a
comparatively low temperature. So long as it is covered
with water, no amount of heat will melt it, since the water
conducts the heat away from the metal and never allows
it to rise above a certain temperature. When the plug is
no longer covered with water, however,—in short, when
the water has fallen below the danger line in the boiler—the
metal in the plug will fuse, or melt, and make an opening
through which the steam will blow into the firebox
and put out the fire. However, if the top of the fusible
plug has been allowed to become thickly coated with scale,
this safety precaution may not work and the boiler may
explode. In any case the fusible plug is not to be depended
on.</p>

<p>At the same time a good engineer will take every precaution,
and one of these is to keep the top of the plug
well cleaned. Also he will have an extra plug all ready
and filled with composition metal, to put in should the
plug in the boiler melt out. Then he will refill the old
plug as soon as possible. This may be done by putting a
little moist clay in one end to prevent the hot metal from
running through, and then pouring into the other end of
the plug as much melted metal as it will hold. When cold,
tamp down solidly.</p>


<h3>LEAKY FLUES.</h3>

<p>One common cause of leaky flues is leaving the fire door
open so that currents of cold air will rush in on the heated
flues and cause them, or some other parts of the boiler, to
contract too suddenly. The best boiler made may be
ruined in time by allowing cold currents of air to strike
the heated interior. Once or twice will not do it; but continually
<a id="Page_74" href="#Page_74" class="pagenum" title="74"> </a>
leaving the fire door open will certainly work
mischief in the end.</p>

<p>Of course, if flues in a new boiler leak, it is the fault of
the boiler maker. The tubes were not large enough to
fill the holes in the tube sheets properly. But if a boiler
runs for a season or so and then the flues begin to leak,
the chances are that it is due to the carelessness of the engineer.
It may be he has been making his fires too hot;
it may be leaving the firebox door open; it may be running
the boiler at too high pressure; it may be blowing out the
boiler when it is too hot; or blowing out the boiler when
there is still some fire in the firebox; it may be due to lime
encrusted on the inside of the tube sheets, causing them
to overheat. Flues may also be made to leak by pumping
cold water into the boiler when the water inside is too low;
or pouring cold water into a hot boiler will do it. Some
engineers blow out their boilers to clean them, and then
being in a hurry to get to work, refill them while the metal
is hot. The flues cannot stand this, since they are thinner
than the shell of the boiler and cool much more quickly;
hence they will contract much faster than the rest of the
boiler and something has to come loose.</p>

<p>Once a flue starts to leaking, it is not likely to stop till
it has been repaired; and one leaky flue will make others
leak.</p>

<p>Now what shall you do with a leaky flue?</p>

<p>To repair a leaky flue you should have a flue expander
and a calking tool, with a light hammer. If you are
small enough you will creep in at the firebox door with a
candle in your hand. First, clean off the ends of the flues
and flue sheet with some cotton waste. Then force the expander
into the leaky flue, bringing the shoulder well up
against the end of the flue. Then drive in the tapering
pin. Be very careful not to drive it in too far, for if you
expand the flue too much, you will strain the flue sheet
and cause other flues to leak. You must use your judgment
and proceed cautiously. It is better to make two or
three trials than to spoil your boiler by bad work. The
roller expander is preferable to the Prosser in the hands
<a id="Page_75" href="#Page_75" class="pagenum" title="75"> </a>
of a novice. The tube should be expanded only enough
to stop the leak. Farther expanding will only do injury.</p>

<p>When you think the flue has been expanded enough, hit
the pin a side blow to loosen it. Then turn the expander
a quarter round, and drive in the pin again. Loosen up
and continue till you have turned the expander entirely
around.</p>

<p>Finally remove the expander, and use the calking tool
to bead the end. It is best, however, to expand all leaky
flues before doing any beading.</p>

<p>The beading is done by placing the guide or gauge inside
the flue, and then pounding the ends of the flue down
against the flue sheet by light blows. Be very careful not
to bruise the flue sheet or flues, and use no heavy blows,
nor even a heavy hammer. Go slowly and carefully
around the end of each flue; and if you have done your
work thoroughly and carefully the flues will be all right.
But you should test your boiler before steaming up, to
make sure that all the leaks are stopped, especially if there
have been bad ones.</p>

<p>There are various ways to testing a boiler. If waterworks
are handy, connect the boiler with a hydrant and
after filling the boiler, let it receive the hydrant pressure.
Then examine the calked flues carefully, and if you see
any seeping of water, use your beader lightly till the water
stops. In case no waterworks with good pressure are at
hand, you can use a hydraulic pump or a good force
pump.</p>

<p>The amount of pressure required in testing a boiler
should be that at which the safety valve is set to blow off,
say 110 to 130 lbs. This will be sufficient.</p>

<p>If you are in the field with no hydrant or force pump
handy, you may test your boiler in this way: Take off
the safety valve and fill the boiler full of water through
the safety valve opening. Then screw the safety back in
its place. You should be sure that every bit of space in
the boiler is filled entirely full of water, with all openings
tightly closed. Then get back in the boiler and have a
bundle of straw burned under the firebox, or under the
waist of the boiler, so that at some point the water will be
<a id="Page_76" href="#Page_76" class="pagenum" title="76"> </a>
slightly heated. This will cause pressure. If your safety
valve is in perfect order, you will know as soon as water
begins to escape at the safety valve whether your flues are
calked tight enough or not.</p>

<p>The water is heated only a few degrees, and the pressure
is cold water pressure. In very cold weather this
method cannot be used, however, as water has no expansive
force within five degrees of freezing.</p>

<p>The above methods are not intended for testing the
safety of a boiler, but only for testing for leaky flues. If
you wish to have your boiler tested, it is better to get an
expert to do it.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">HOW TO MANAGE A TRACTION ENGINE.</span></h2>


<p>A traction engine is usually the simplest kind of an engine
made. If it were not, it would require a highly expert
engineer to run it, and this would be too costly for a
farmer or thresherman contractor. Therefore the builders
of traction engines make them of the fewest possible
parts, and in the most durable and simple style. Still,
even the simplest engine requires a certain amount of
brains to manage it properly, especially if you are to get
the maximum of work out of it at the lowest cost.</p>

<p>If the engine is in perfect order, about all you have to
do is to see that all bearings are properly lubricated, and
that the automatic oiler is in good working condition.
But as soon as an engine has been used for a certain time,
there will be wear, which will appear first in the journals,
boxes and valve, and it is the first duty of a good engineer
to adjust these. To adjust them accurately requires skill;
and it is the possession of that skill that goes to make a
real engineer.</p>

<p>Your first attention will probably be required for the
cross-head and crank boxes or brasses. The crank box
and pin will probably wear first; but both the cross-head
and crank boxes are so nearly alike that what is said of
one will apply to the other.</p>

<p>You will find the wrist box in two parts. In a new engine
these parts do not quite meet. There is perhaps an
eighth of an inch waste space between them. They are
brought up to the box in most farm engines by a wedge-shaped
key. This should be driven down a little at a
time as the boxes wear, so as to keep them snug up to the
pin, though not too tight.</p>

<p>You continue to drive in the key and tighten up the
boxes as they wear until the two halves come tight together.
<a id="Page_78" href="#Page_78" class="pagenum" title="78"> </a>
Then you can no longer accomplish anything in
this way.</p>

<p>When the brasses have worn so that they can be forced
no closer together, they must be taken off and the ends of
them filed where they come together. File off a sixteenth
of an inch from each end. Do it with care, and be sure
you get the ends perfectly even. When you have done
this you will have another eighth of an inch to allow for
wear.</p>

<p>Now, by reflection you will see that as the wrist box
wears, and the wedge-shaped key is driven in, the pitman
(or piston arm) is lengthened to the amount that the half
of the box farthest from the piston has worn away. When
the brasses meet, this will amount to one-sixteenth of an
inch.</p>

<p>Now if you file the ends off and the boxes wear so as
to come together once more, the pitman will have been
shortened one-eighth of an inch; and pretty soon the clearance
of the piston in the cylinder will have been offset,
and the engine will begin to pound. In any case, the clearance
at one end of the cylinder will be one-sixteenth or one-eighth
of an inch less, and in the other end one-sixteenth
or one-eighth of an inch more. When this is the case you
will find that the engine is not working well.</p>

<p>To correct this, when you file the brasses either of the
cross-head box or the crank box you must put in some
filling back of the brass farthest from the piston, sufficient
to equalize the wear that has taken place, that is,
one-sixteenth of an inch each time you have to file off a
sixteenth of an inch. This filling may be some flat pieces
of tin or sheet copper, commonly called shims, and the
process is called shimming. As to the front half of the
box, no shims are required, since the tapering key brings
that box up to its proper place.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised when driving in the
tapering key or wedge to tighten up the boxes, not to
drive it in too hard. Many engineers think this is a sure
remedy for “knocking” in an engine, and every time
they hear a knock they drive in the crank box key. Often
the knock is from some other source, such as from a loose
<a id="Page_79" href="#Page_79" class="pagenum" title="79"> </a>
fly wheel, or the like. Your ear is likely to deceive you;
for a knock from any part of an engine is likely to sound
as if it came from the crank box. If you insist on driving
in the key too hard and too often, you will ruin your
engine.</p>

<p>In tightening up a key, first loosen the set screw that
holds the key; then drive down the key till you think it
is tight; then drive it back again, and this time force it
down with your fist as far as you can. By using your
fist in this way after you have once driven the pin in
tight and loosened it again you may be pretty certain
you are not going to get it so tight it will cause the box
to heat.</p>


<h3>WHAT CAUSES AN ENGINE TO KNOCK.</h3>

<p>The most common sign that something is loose about
an engine is “knocking,” as it is called. If any box wears
a little loose, or any wheel or the like gets a trifle loose,
the engine will begin to knock.</p>

<p>When an engine begins to knock or run hard, it is the
duty of the engineer to locate the knock definitely. He
must not guess at it. When he has studied the problem
out carefully, and knows where the knock is, then he may
proceed to remedy it. Never adjust more than one part
at a time.</p>

<p>As we have said, a knock is usually due to looseness
somewhere. The journals of the main shaft may be loose
and cause knocking. They are held in place by set bolts
and jam nuts, and are tightened by simply screwing up
the nuts. But a small turn of a nut may make the box so
tight it will begin to heat at once. Great care should be
taken in tightening up such a box to be sure not to get it
too tight. Once a box begins to cut, it should be taken
out and thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>Knocking may be due to a loose eccentric yoke. There
is packing between the two halves of the yoke, and to
tighten up you must take out a thin layer of this packing.
But be careful not to take out too much, or the eccentric
will stick and begin to slip.</p>

<p>Another cause of knocking is the piston rod loose in
<a id="Page_80" href="#Page_80" class="pagenum" title="80"> </a>
the cross-head. If the piston rod is keyed to the cross-head
it is less liable to get loose than if it were fastened
by a nut; but if the key continues to get loose, it will be
best to replace it with a new one.</p>

<p>Unless the piston rod is kept tight in the cross-head,
there is liability of a bad crack. A small strain will bring
the piston out of the cross-head entirely, when the chances
are you will knock out one or both cylinder-heads. If a
nut is used, there will be the same danger if it comes off.
It should therefore be carefully watched. The best way
is to train the ear to catch any usual sound, when loosening
of the key or nut will be detected at once.</p>

<p>Another source of knocking is looseness of the cross-head
in the guides. Provision is usually made for taking
up the wear; but if there is not, you can take off the
guides and file them or have them planed off. You should
take care to see that they are kept even, so that they will
wear smooth with the crosshead shoes.</p>

<p>If the fly-wheel is in the least loose it will also cause
knocking, and it will puzzle you not a little to locate it.
It may appear to be tight; but if the key is the least bit
too narrow for the groove in the shaft, it will cause an engine
to bump horribly, very much as too much “lead”
will.</p>


<h3>LEAD.</h3>

<p>We have already explained what “lead” is. It is opening
of the port at either end of the steam cylinder allowed
by the valve when the engine is on a dead centre. To find
out what the lead is, the cover of the steam chest must be
taken off, and the engine placed at each dead centre in
succession. If the lead is greater at one end than it is at
the other, the valve must be adjusted to equalize it. As a
rule the engine is adjusted with a suitable amount of lead
if it is equalized. The correct amount of lead varies with
the engine and with the port opening. If the port opening
is long and narrow, the lead should obviously be less than
if the port is short and wide.</p>

<p>If the lead is insufficient, there will not be enough steam
let into the cylinder for cushion, and the engine will
knock. If there is too much lead the speed of the engine
<a id="Page_81" href="#Page_81" class="pagenum" title="81"> </a>
will be lessened, and it will not do the work it ought. To
adjust the lead <i>de novo</i> is by no means an easy task.</p>


<h3>HOW TO SET A SIMPLE VALVE.</h3>

<p>In order to set a valve the engine must be brought to
a dead centre. This cannot be done accurately by the
eye. An old engineer<a id="Marker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="marker" title="Footnote 5">5</a> gives the following directions for
finding the dead centre accurately. Says he: “First provide
yourself with a ‘tram.’ This is a rod of one-fourth
inch iron about eighteen inches long, with two inches at
one end bent over to a sharp angle. Sharpen both ends
to a point. Fasten a block of hard wood somewhere near
the face of the fly-wheel, so that when the straight end
of your tram is placed at a definite point in the block, the
hooked end will reach the crown of the fly-wheel. The
block must be held firmly in its place, and the tram must
always touch it at exactly the same point.</p>

<p>“You are now ready to set about finding the dead centre.
In doing this, remember to turn the fly-wheel always
in the same direction.</p>

<p>“Bring the engine over till it nearly reaches one of the
dead centres, but not quite. Make a distinct mark across
the cross-head and guides. Also go around to the flywheel,
and placing the straight end of the tram at the
selected point on the block of wood, make a mark across
the crown or centre of face of the fly-wheel. Now turn
your engine past the centre, and on to a point at which
the mark on the cross head will once more exactly correspond
with the line on the guides, making a single
straight line. Once more place the tram as before and
make another mark across the crown of the fly-wheel. By
use of dividers, find the exact centre between the two
marks made on the fly-wheel, and mark this point distinctly
with a centre punch. Now bring the fly-wheel
to the point where the tram, set with its straight end at
the required point on the block of wood, will touch this
point with the hooked end, and you will have one of the
dead centres.</p>

<a id="Page_82" href="#Page_82" class="pagenum" title="82"> </a>

<p>“Turn the engine over and proceed in the same way to
find the other dead centre.”</p>

<p>Now, setting the engine on one of the dead centres, remove
the cover of the steam chest and proceed to set
your valve.</p>

<p>Assuming that the engine maker gave the valve the
proper amount of lead in the first place, you can proceed
on the theory that it is merely necessary to equalize the
lead at both ends. Assume some convenient lead, as one-sixteenth
of an inch, and set the valve to that. Then turn
the engine over and see if the lead at the other end is the
same. If it is the same, you have set the valve correctly.
If it is less at the other end, you may conclude that the
lead at both ends should be less than one-sixteenth of an
inch, and must proceed to equalize it. This you can do
by fitting into the open space a little wedge of wood,
changing the valve a little until the wedge goes in to just
the same distance at each end. Then you may know that
the lead at one end is the same as at the other end. You
can mark the wedge for forcing it against the metal, or
mark it against the seat of the valve with a pencil.</p>

<p>The valve is set by loosening the set screws that hold
the eccentric on the shaft. When these are loosened up
the valve may be moved freely. When it is correctly set
the screws should be tightened, and the relative position
of the eccentric on the shaft may be permanently marked
by setting a cold chisel so that it will cut into the shaft
and the eccentric at the same time and giving it a smart
blow with the hammer, so as to make a mark on both
the eccentric and the shaft. Should your eccentric slip
at any time in the future, you can set your valve by simply
bringing the mark on the eccentric so that it will
correspond with the mark on the shaft. Many engines
have such a mark made when built, to facilitate setting
a valve should the eccentric become loose.</p>

<p>These directions apply only to setting the valve of a
single eccentric engine.</p>


<h3>HOW TO SET A VALVE ON A DOUBLE ECCENTRIC ENGINE.</h3>

<p>In setting a valve on a reversible or double eccentric
engine, the link may cause confusion, and you may be
<a id="Page_83" href="#Page_83" class="pagenum" title="83"> </a>
trying to set the valve to run one way when the engine is
set to run the other.</p>

<p>The valve on such an engine is exactly the same as on
a single eccentric engine. Set the reverse lever for the
engine to go forward. Then set the valve exactly as with
a single eccentric engine. When you have done so, tighten
the eccentric screws so that they will hold temporarily,
and set the reverse lever for the engine to go backward.
Then put the engine on dead centres and see if the valve
is all right at both ends. If it is, you may assume that it
is correctly set, and tighten eccentric screws, marking both
eccentrics as before.</p>

<p>As we have said, most engines are marked in the factory,
so that it is not a difficult matter to set the valves,
it being necessary only to bring the eccentric around
so that the mark on it will correspond with the mark on
the shaft.</p>

<p>You can easily tell whether the lead is the same at both
ends by listening to the exhaust. If it is longer at one
end than the other, the valve is not properly set.</p>


<h3>SLIPPING OF THE ECCENTRIC OR VALVE.</h3>

<p>If the eccentric slips the least bit it may cause the
engine to stop, or to act very queerly. Therefore the
marks on the shaft and on the eccentric should be watched
closely, and of course all grease and dirt should be kept
wiped off, so that they can be seen easily. Then the
jam nuts should be tightened up a little from time to
time.</p>

<p>If the engine seems to act strangely, and yet the eccentrics
are all right, look at the valve in the steam chest.
If the valve stem has worked loose from the valve, trouble
will be caused. It may be held in place by a nut, and the
nut may work off; or the valve may be held by a clamp
and pin, and the pin may work loose. Either will cause
loss of motion, and perhaps a sudden stopping of the
engine.</p>


<h3>USE OF THE CYLINDER STEAM COCKS.</h3>

<p>It is a comparatively simple matter to test a steam
cylinder by use of the cylinder cocks. To do this, open
<a id="Page_84" href="#Page_84" class="pagenum" title="84"> </a>
both cocks, place the engine on the forward center, and
turn on a little steam. If the steam blows out at the
forward cock, we may judge that our lead is all right.
Now turn the engine to the back center and let on the
steam. It should blow out the same at the back cock. A
little training of the ear will show whether the escape of
steam is the same at both ends. Then reverse the engine,
set it on each center successfully, and notice whether the
steam blows out from one cock at a time and in the same
degree of force.</p>

<p>If the steam blows out of both cocks at the same time,
or out of one cock on one center, but not out of the
other cock on its corresponding center, we may know
something is wrong. The valve does not work properly.</p>

<p>We will first look at the eccentrics and see that they
are all right. If they are, we must open the steam chest,
first turning off all steam. Probably we shall find that
the valve is loose on the valve rod, if our trouble was
that the steam blew out of the cock but did not out of
the other when the engine was on the opposite center.</p>

<p>If our trouble was that steam blew out of both cocks
at the same time, we may conclude either that the cylinder
rings leak or else the valve has cut its seat. It will be
a little difficult to tell which at first sight. In any case
it is a bad thing, for it means loss of power and waste of
steam and fuel. To tell just where the trouble is you
must take off the cylinder head, after setting the engine
on the forward center. Let in a little steam from the
throttle. If it blows through around the rings, the
trouble is with them; but if it blows through the valve
port, the trouble is with the valve and valve seat.</p>

<p>If the rings leak you must get a new set if they are of
the self-adjusting type. But if they are of the spring or
adjusting type you can set them out yourself; but few
engines now use the latter kind of rings, so a new pair
will probably be required.</p>

<p>If the trouble is in the valve and valve seat, you should
take the valve out and have the seat planed down, and
the valve fitted to the seat. This should always be done
<a id="Page_85" href="#Page_85" class="pagenum" title="85"> </a>
by a skilled mechanic fully equipped for such work, as a
novice is almost sure to make bad work of it. The valve
seat and valve must be scraped down by the use of a flat
piece of very hard steel, an eighth of an inch thick and
about 3 by 4 inches in size. The scraping edge must be
absolutely straight. It will be a slow and tedious process,
and a little too much scraping on one side or the other
will prevent a perfect fit. Both valve and valve seat must
be scraped equally. Novices sometimes try to reseat a
valve by the use of emery. This is very dangerous and is
sure to ruin the valve, as it works into the pores of the
iron and causes cutting.</p>


<h3>LUBRICATION.</h3>

<p>A knowledge of the difference between good oil and
poor oil, and of how to use oil and grease, is a prime
essential for an engineer.</p>

<p>First let us give a little attention to the theory of
lubrication. The oil or grease should form a lining
between the journal and its pin or shaft. It is in the
nature of a slight and frictionless cushion at all points
where the two pieces of metal meet.</p>

<p>Now if oil is to keep its place between the bearing
and the shaft or pin it must stick tight to both pieces of
metal, and the tighter the better. If the oil is light the
forces at work on the bearings will force the oil away
and bring the metals together. As soon as they come
together they begin to wear on each other, and sometimes
the wear is very rapid. This is called “cutting.” If a
little sand or grit gets into the bearing, that will help
the cutting wonderfully, and more especially if there is
no grease there.</p>

<p>For instance, gasoline and kerosene are oils, but they
are so light they will not stick to a journal, and so are
valueless for lubricating. Good lubricating oil will cost
a little more than cheap oil which has been mixed with
worthless oils to increase its bulk without increasing its
cost. The higher priced oil will really cost less in the
end, because there is a larger percentage of it which will
<a id="Page_86" href="#Page_86" class="pagenum" title="86"> </a>
do service. A good engineer will have it in his contract
that he is to be furnished with good oil.</p>

<p>Now an engine requires two different kinds of oil, one
for the bearings, such as the crank, pin, the cross-head
and journals, and quite a different kind for lubricating
the steam cylinder.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that the steam cylinder should
be well lubricated; and this cannot be done direct. The
oil must be carried into the valve and cylinder with steam.
The heat of the steam, moreover, ranging from about 320
degrees Fahr. for 90 lbs. pressure to 350 degrees for
125 lbs. of pressure, will quickly destroy the efficacy of a
poor oil, and a good cylinder oil must be one that will
stick to the cylinder and valve seat under this high temperature.
It must have staying qualities.</p>

<p>The link reverse is one of the best for its purpose; but
it requires a good quality of oil on the valve for it to
work well. If the valve gets a little dry, or the poor oil
used does not serve its purpose properly, the link will begin
to jump and pound. This is a reason why makers are
substituting other kinds of reverse gear in many ways
not as good, but not open to this objection. If a link
reverse begins to pound when you are using good oil, and
the oiler is working properly, you may be sure something
is the matter with the valve or the gear.</p>

<p>A good engineer will train his ear so that he will detect
by simply listening at the cylinder whether everything is
working exactly as it ought. For example, the exhaust
at each end of the cylinder, which you can hear distinctly,
should be the same and equal. If the exhaust
at one end is less than it is at the other, you may know
that one end of the cylinder is doing more work than
the other. And also any little looseness or lack of oil
will signify itself by the peculiar sound it will cause.</p>

<p>While the cylinder requires cylinder oil, the crank,
cross-head and journals require engine oil, or hard grease.
The use of hard grease is rapidly increasing, and it is
highly to be recommended. With a good automatic
spring grease cup hard grease will be far less likely to
let the bearings heat than common oil will. At the same
<a id="Page_87" href="#Page_87" class="pagenum" title="87"> </a>
time it will be much easier to keep an engine clean if hard
grease is used.</p>

<p>An old engineer<a id="Marker_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="marker" title="Footnote 6">6</a> gives the following directions for
fitting a grease cup on a box not previously arranged for
one: “Remove the journal, take a gouge and cut a
clean groove across the box, starting at one corner, about
one-eighth of an inch from the point of the box, and
cut diagonally across, coming out at the opposite corner
on the other end of the box. Then start at the opposite
corner and run through as before, crossing the first groove
in the center of the box. Groove both halves of the box
the same, being careful not to cut out at either end, as
this will allow the grease to escape from the box and
cause unnecessary waste. The shimming or packing in
the box should be cut so as to touch the journal at both
ends of the box, but not in the center or between these
two points. So when the top box is brought down tight
this will form another reservoir for the grease. If the
box is not tapped directly in the center for the cup, it will
be necessary to cut another groove from where it is
tapped into the grooves already made. A box prepared
in this way and carefully polished inside, will require little
attention if you use good grease.”</p>


<h3>A HOT BOX.</h3>

<p>When a box heats in the least degree, it is a sign that
for lack of oil or for some other reason the metals are
wearing together.</p>

<p>The first thing to do, of course, is to see that the box is
supplied with plenty of good oil or grease.</p>

<p>If this does not cause the box to cool off, take it apart
and clean it thoroughly. Then coat the journal with white
lead mixed with good oil. Great care should be exercised
to keep all dirt or grit out of your can of lead and away
from the bearing.</p>

<p>Replace the oil or grease cup, and the box will soon cool
down.</p>

<h3>THE FRICTION CLUTCH.</h3>

<p>Nearly all traction engines are now provided with the
friction clutch for engaging the engine with the propelling
gear.   The clutch is usually provided with wooden shoes,
which are adjustable as they
wear; and the clutch is thrown
on by a lever, conveniently placed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_088">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="300" height="289" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A.&nbsp;W. STEVENS CO. FRICTION
CLUTCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Before running an engine, you
must make sure that the clutch
shoes are properly adjusted.
Great care must be taken to be
sure that both shoes will come in
contact with the friction wheel
at the same instant; for if one
shoe touches the wheel before
the other the clutch will probably
slip.</p>

<p>The shoes should be so set as to make it a trifle difficult
to draw the lever clear back.</p>

<p>To regulate the shoes on the Rumely engine, for example,
first throw the friction in. The nut on the top of the
toggle connecting the sleeve of the friction with the shoe
must then be loosened, and the nut below the shoe tightened
up, forcing the shoe toward the wheel. Both shoes
should be carefully adjusted so that they will engage the
band wheel equally and at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>To use the friction clutch, first start the engine, throwing
the throttle gradually wide open. When the engine is
running at its usual speed, slowly bring up the clutch until
the gearing is fully engaged, letting the engine start slowly
and smoothly, without any jar.</p>

<p>Traction engines having the friction clutch are also
provided with a pin for securing a rigid connection, to be
used in cases of necessity, as when the clutch gets broken
or something about it gives out, or you have difficulty in
making it hold when climbing hills. This pin is a simple
round or square pin that can be placed through a hole in
one of the spokes of the band wheel until it comes into a
similar opening in the friction wheel. When the pin is
taken out, so as to disconnect the wheels, it must be entirely
<a id="Page_89" href="#Page_89" class="pagenum" title="89"> </a>
removed, not left sticking in the hole, as it is liable
to catch in some other part of the machinery.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS.</h3>

<p>Be careful not to open the throttle valve too quickly, or
you may throw off the driving belt. You may also stir up
the water and cause it to pass over with the steam,
starting what is called “priming.”</p>

<p>Always open your cylinder cocks when you stop, to
make sure all water has been drained out of the cylinder;
and see that they are open when you start, of course closing
them as soon as the steam is let in.</p>

<p>When you pull out the ashes always have a pail of water
ready, for you may start a fire that will do no end of
damage.</p>

<p>If the water in your boiler gets low and you are waiting
<a id="Page_90" href="#Page_90" class="pagenum" title="90"> </a>
for the tank to come up, don’t think you “can keep
on a little longer,” but stop your engine at once. It is
better to lose a little time than run the risk of an explosion
that will ruin your reputation as an engineer and
cause your employer a heavy expense.</p>

<p>Never start the pump when the water in the boiler is
low.</p>

<p>Be sure the exhaust nozzle does not get limed up, and
be sure the pipe where the water enters the boiler from
the heater is not limed up, or you may split a heater pipe
or knock out a check valve.</p>

<p>Never leave your engine in cold weather without draining
off all the water; and always cover up your engine
when you leave it.</p>

<p>Never disconnect the engine with a leaky throttle.</p>

<p>Keep the steam pressure steady, not varying more than
10 to 15 lbs.</p>

<p>If called on to run an old boiler, have it thoroughly
tested before you touch it.</p>

<p>Always close your damper before pulling through a
stack yard.</p>

<p>Examine every bridge before you pull on to it.</p>

<p>Do not stop going down a steep grade.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI" href="#toc">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<span class="chapter-title">HANDLING A TRACTION ENGINE ON THE ROAD.</span></h2>


<p>It is something of a trick to handle a traction engine on
the road. The novice is almost certain to run it into a
ditch the first thing, or get stuck on a hill, or in a sand
patch or a mudhole. Some attention must therefore be
paid to handling a traction engine on the road.</p>

<p>In the first place, never pull the throttle open with a
jerk, nor put down the reverse lever with a snap. Handle
your engine deliberately and thoughtfully, knowing beforehand
just what you wish to do and how you will do it.
A traction engine is much like an ox; try to goad it on
too fast and it will stop and turn around on you. It does
its best work when moving slowly and steadily, and seldom
is anything gained by rushing.</p>

<p>The first thing for an engineer to learn is to handle his
throttle. When an engine is doing work the throttle
should be wide open; but on the road, or in turning, backing,
etc., the engineer’s hand must be on the throttle all
the time and he must exercise a nice judgment as to just
how much steam the engine will need to do a certain
amount of work. This the novice will find out best by
opening the throttle slowly, taking all the time he needs,
and never allowing any one to hurry him.</p>

<p>As an engineer learns the throttle, he gradually comes
to have confidence in it. As it were, he feels the pulse of
the animal and never makes a mistake. Such an engineer
always has power to spare, and never wastes any power.
He finds that a little is often much better than too much.</p>

<p>The next thing to learn is the steering wheel. It has
tricks of its own, which one must learn by practice. Most
young engineers turn the wheel altogether too much. If
you let your engine run slowly you will have time to turn
the wheel slowly, and accomplish just what you want to
do. If you hurry you will probably have to do your work
<a id="Page_92" href="#Page_92" class="pagenum" title="92"> </a>
all over again, and so lose much more time in the end
than if you didn’t hurry.</p>

<p>Always keep your eyes on the front wheels of the engine,
and do not turn around to see how your load is coming
on. Your load will take care of itself if you manage
the front wheels all right, for they determine where you
are to go.</p>

<p>In making a hard turn, especially, go slow. Then you
will run no chance of losing control of your engine, and
you can see that neither you nor your load gets into a
ditch.</p>


<h3>GETTING INTO A HOLE.</h3>

<p>You are sure sooner or later to get into a hole in the
road, for a traction engine is so heavy it is sure to find
any soft spot in the road there may be.</p>

<p>As to getting out of a hole, observe in the first place
that you must use your best judgment.</p>

<p>First, never let the drive wheels turn round without
doing any work. The more they spin round without
helping you, the worse it will be for you.</p>

<p>Your first thought must be to give the drive wheels
something they can climb on, something they can stick
to. A heavy chain is perhaps the very best thing you can
put under them. But usually on the road you have no
chain handy. In that case, you must do what you can. Old
hay or straw will help you; and so will old rails or any
old timber.</p>

<p>Spend your time trying to give your wheels something
to hold to, rather than trying to pull out. When the
wheels are all right, the engine will go on its way without
any trouble whatever. And do not half do your
work of fixing the wheels before you try to start. See
that both wheels are secure before you put on a pound of
steam. Make sure of this the first time you try, and you
will save time in the end. If you fix one wheel and don’t
fix the other, you will probably spoil the first wheel by
starting before the other is ready.</p>

<p>Should you be where your engine will not turn, then
you are stuck indeed. You must lighten your load or dig
a way out.</p>
<a id="Page_93" href="#Page_93" class="pagenum" title="93"> </a>


<h3>BAD BRIDGES.</h3>

<p>A traction engine is so heavy that the greatest care
must be exercised in crossing bridges. If a bridge floor
is worn, if you see rotten planks in it, or liability of
holes, don’t pull on to that bridge without taking precautions.</p>

<p>The best precaution is to carry with you a couple of
planks sixteen feet long, three inches thick in the middle,
tapering to two inches at the ends; also a couple of planks
eight feet long and two inches thick, the latter for culverts
and to help out on long bridges.</p>

<p>Before pulling on to a bad looking bridge, lay down
your planks, one for each pair of wheels of the engine
to run on. Be exceedingly careful not to let the engine
drop off the edge of these planks on the way over, or pass
over the ends on to the floor of the bridge. If one pair
of planks is too short, use your second pair.</p>

<p>Another precaution which it is wise to take is to carry
fifty feet of good, stout hemp rope, and when you come to
a shaky bridge, attach your separator to the engine by
this rope at full length, so that the engine will have
crossed the bridge before the weight of the separator
comes upon it.</p>

<p>Cross a bad bridge very slowly. Nothing will be gained
by hurrying. There should especially be no sudden jerks
or starts.</p>


<h3>SAND PATCHES.</h3>

<p>A sandy road is an exceedingly hard road to pull a
load over.</p>

<p>In the first place, don’t hurry over sand. If you do
you are liable to break the footing of the wheels, and
then you are gone.</p>

<p>In the second place, keep your engine as steady and
straight as possible, so that both wheels will always have
an equal and even bearing. They are less liable to slip if
you do. It is useless to try to “wiggle” over a sand patch.
Slow, steady, and even is the rule.</p>

<p>If your wheels slip in sand, a bundle of straw or hay,
<a id="Page_94" href="#Page_94" class="pagenum" title="94"> </a>
especially old hay, will be about the best thing to give
them a footing.</p>


<h3>HILLS.</h3>

<p>In climbing hills take the same advice we have given
you all along: Go slow. Nothing is gained by rushing
at a hill with a steam engine. Such an engine works best
when its force is applied steadily and evenly, a little at a
time.</p>

<p>If you have a friction clutch, as you probably will
have, you should be sure it is in good working order before
you attempt to climb hills. It should be adjusted to
a nicety, as we have already explained. When you come
to a bad hill it would probably be well to put in the tight
gear pin; or use it altogether in a hilly country.</p>

<p>When the friction clutch first came into use, salesmen
and others used to make the following recommendation (a
recommendation which we will say right here is bad).
They said, when you come to an obstacle in the road that
you can’t very well get your engine over, throw off your
friction clutch from the road wheels, let your engine get
under good headway running free, and then suddenly
put on the friction clutch and jerk yourself over the obstacle.</p>

<p>Now this is no doubt one way to get over an obstacle;
but no good engineer would take his chances of spoiling
his engine by doing any such thing with it. Some part of
it would be badly strained by such a procedure; and if
this were done regularly all through a season, an engine
would be worth very little at the end of the season.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.<br />

THE BOILER.</h3>

<p>Q. How should water be fed to a boiler?</p>

<p>A. In a steady stream, by use of a pump or injector
working continuously and supplying just the amount of
water required. By this means the water in the boiler
is maintained at a uniform level, and produces steam most
evenly and perfectly.</p>

<p>Q. Why should pure water be used in a boiler?</p>

<p>A. Because impure water, or hard water, forms scales
on the boiler flues and plates, and these scales act as non-conductors
of heat. Thus the heat of the furnace is not
able to pass easily through the boiler flues and plates to
the water, and your boiler becomes what is called “a
hard steamer.”</p>

<p>Q. What must be done to prevent the formation of
scale?</p>

<p>A. First, use some compound that will either prevent
scale from forming, or will precipitate the scale forming
substance as a soft powder that can easily be washed off.
Sal soda dissolved in the feed water is recommended, but
great care should be exercised in the use of sal soda not
to use too much at a time, as it may cause a boiler to
foam. Besides using a compound, clean your boiler often
and regularly with a hand hose and a force pump, and
soak it out as often as possible by using rain water for
a day or two, especially before cleaning. Rain water will
soften and bring down the hard scale far better than any
compound.</p>

<p>Q. How often should you clean your boiler?</p>

<p>A. As often as it needs it, which will depend upon the
work you do and the condition of the water. Once a
<a id="Page_96" href="#Page_96" class="pagenum" title="96"> </a>
week is usually often enough if the boiler is blown down
a little every day. If your water is fairly good, once a
month will be often enough. A boiler should be blown
off about one gauge at a time two or three times a day
with the blow-off if the water is muddy.</p>

<p>Q. How long should the surface blow-off be left
open?</p>

<p>A. Only for a few seconds, and seldom longer than
a minute. The surface blow-off carries off the scum that
forms on the water, and other impurities that rise with
the scum.</p>

<p>Q. How do you clean a boiler by blowing off?</p>

<p>A. When the pressure has been allowed to run down
open the blow-off valve at the bottom of the boiler and let
the water blow out less than a minute, till the water drops
out of sight in the water gauges, or about two and one-half
inches. Blowing<!--TN: was 'Blown'--> off more is only a waste of heat and
fuel.</p>

<p>Q. What harm will be done by blowing off a boiler
under a high pressure of steam?</p>

<p>A. The heat in the boiler while there is such a pressure
will be so great that it will bake the scale on the
inside of the boiler, and it will be very difficult to remove
it afterward. After a boiler has been blown off the scale
should be for the most part soft, so that it can be washed
out by a hose and force pump.</p>

<p>Q. Why should a hot boiler never be filled with cold
water?</p>

<p>A. Because the cold water will cause the boiler to
contract more in some places than in others, and so suddenly
that the whole will be badly strained. Leaky flues
are made in this way, and the life of a boiler greatly
shortened. As a rule a boiler should be filled only when
the metal and the water put into it are about at the same
temperature.</p>

<p>Q. After a boiler has been cleaned, how should the
manhole and manhole plates be replaced?</p>

<p>A. They are held in position by a bolt passing through
a yoke that straddles the hole; but to be steam and water
tight they must have packing all around the junction of
the plate with the boiler. The best packing is sheet rubber
<a id="Page_97" href="#Page_97" class="pagenum" title="97"> </a>
cut in the form of a ring just the right size for the
bearing surface. Hemp or cotton packing are also used,
but they should be free from all lumps and soaked in oil.
Do not use any more than is absolutely needed. Be careful,
also, to see that the bearings of the plate and boiler
are clean and smooth, with all the old packing scraped
off. Candle wick saturated with red lead is next best to
rubber as packing.</p>

<p>Q. What are the chief duties of an engineer in care
of a boiler?</p>

<p>A. First, to watch all gauges, fittings, and working
parts, to see that they are in order; try the gauge cocks
to make sure the water is at the right height; try the
safety valve from time to time to be sure it is working;
see that there are no leaks, that there is no rusting or
wearing of parts, or to replace parts when they do begin
to show wear; to examine the check valve frequently to
make sure no water can escape through it from the
boiler; take precautions against scale and stoppage of
pipes by scale; and keep the fire going uniformly, cleanly,
and in an economical fashion.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do if the glass water gauge
breaks?</p>

<p>A. Turn off the gauge cocks above and below, the
lower one first so that the hot water will not burn you.
You may put in a new glass and turn on gauge cocks at
once. Turn on the lower or water cock first, then the
upper or steam cock. You may go on without the glass
gauge, however, using the gauge cocks or try cocks every
few minutes to make sure the water is at the right height,
neither too high nor too low.</p>

<p>Q. Why is it necessary to use the gauge cocks when
the glass gauge is all right?</p>

<p>A. First, because you cannot otherwise be sure that
the glass gauge is all right; and, secondly, because if
you do not use them frequently they are likely to become
scaled up so that you cannot use them in case of accident
to the glass gauge.</p>

<p>Q. If a gauge cock gets leaky, what should be done?</p>

<p>A. Nothing until the boiler has cooled down. Then if
the leak is in the seat, take it out and grind and refit it;
<a id="Page_98" href="#Page_98" class="pagenum" title="98"> </a>
if the leak is where the cock is screwed into the boiler,
tighten it up another turn and see if that remedies the
difficulty. If it does not you will probably have to get a
new gauge cock.</p>

<p>Q. Why not screw up a gauge cock while there is a
pressure of steam on?</p>

<p>A. The cock might blow out and cause serious injury
to yourself or some one else. Make it a rule never to fool
with any boiler fittings while there is a pressure of steam
on the boiler. It is exceedingly dangerous.</p>

<p>Sometimes a gauge cock gets broken off accidentally
while the boiler is in use. If such an accident happens,
bank the fire by closing the draft and covering the fire
with fresh fuel or ashes. Stop the engine and let the
water blow out of the hole till only steam appears; then
try to plug the opening with a long whitewood or poplar,
or even a pine stick (six or eight feet long), one end of
which you have whittled down to about the size of the
hole. When the steam has been stopped the stick may
be cut off close to the boiler and the plug driven in tight.
If necessary you may continue to use the boiler in this
condition until a new cock can be put in.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do when a gauge cock is
stopped up?</p>

<p>A. Let the steam pressure go down, and then take
off the front part and run a small wire into the passage,
working the wire back and forth until all scale and
sediment has been removed.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do when the steam gauge gets
out of order.</p>

<p>A. If the steam gauge does not work correctly, or
you suspect it does not, you may test it by running
the steam up until it blows off at the safety valve.
If the steam gauge does not indicate the pressure at
which the safety valve is set to pop off, and you have
reason to suppose the safety valve is all right, you may
conclude that there is something the matter with the
steam gauge. In that case either put in a new one, or,
if you have no extra steam gauge on hand, shut down
your boiler and engine till you can get your steam gauge
<a id="Page_99" href="#Page_99" class="pagenum" title="99"> </a>
repaired. Sometimes this can be done simply by adjusting
the pointer, which may have got loose, and you can
test it by attaching it to another boiler which has a steam
gauge that is all right and by which you can check up
yours. It is VERY DANGEROUS to run your boiler
without a steam gauge, depending on the safety valve.
Never allow the slightest variation in correctness of the
steam gauge without repairing it at once. It will nearly
always be cheaper in these days to put in a new gauge
rather than try to repair the old one.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do if the pump fails to work?</p>

<p>A. Use the injector.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do if there is no injector?</p>

<p>A. Stop the engine at once and bank the fire with
damp ashes, especially noting that the water does not
fall below the bottom of the glass gauge. Then examine
the pump. First see if the plunger leaks air; if it is all
right, examine the check valves, using the little drain
cock as previously explained to test the upper ones, for
the valves may have become worn and will leak; third,
if the check valves are all right, examine the supply pipe,
looking at the strainer, observing whether suction takes
place when the pump is worked, etc. There may be a
leak in the suction hose somewhere during its course
where air can get in, or it may become weak and collapse
under the force of the atmosphere, or the lining
of the suction pipe may have become torn or loose. The
slightest leak in the suction pipe will spoil the working
of the pump. Old tubing should never be used, as it
is sure to give trouble. Finally, examine the delivery
pipe. Close the cock or valve next the boiler, and examine
the boiler check valve; notice whether the pipe is
getting limed up. If necessary, disconnect the pipe and
clean it out with a stiff wire. If everything is all right
up to this point, you must let the boiler cool off, blow
out the water, disconnect the pipe between the check
and the boiler, and thoroughly clean the delivery pipe
into the boiler. Stoppage of the delivery pipe is due to
deposits of lime from the heating of the water in the
heater. Stoppage from this source will be gradual, and
<a id="Page_100" href="#Page_100" class="pagenum" title="100"> </a>
you will find less and less water going into your boiler
from your pump until none flows at all. From this you
may guess the trouble.</p>

<p>Q. How may the communication with the water gauge
always be kept free from lime?</p>

<p>A. By blowing it off through the drain cock at the
bottom. First close the upper cock and blow off for a
few seconds, the water passing through the lower cock;
then close the lower cock and open the upper one, allowing
the steam to blow through this and the drain cock
for a few seconds. If you do this every day or oftener
you will have no trouble.</p>

<p>Q. Should the water get low for any reason, what
should be done?</p>

<p>A. Close all dampers tight so as to prevent all draft,
and bank the fire with fresh fuel or with ashes (damp
ashes are the best if danger is great). Then let the
boiler cool down before putting in fresh water. Banking
the fire is better than drawing or dumping it, as either
of these make the heat greater for a moment or two,
and that additional heat might cause an explosion. Dashing
cold water upon the fire is also very dangerous and
in every way unwise. Again, do not open the safety
valve, for that also, by relieving some of the pressure
on the superheated water, might cause it to burst suddenly
into steam and so cause an explosion.</p>

<p>Q. Under such circumstances, would you stop the
engine?</p>

<p>A. No; for a sudden checking of the outflow of steam
might bring about an explosion. Do nothing but check
the heat as quickly and effectively as you can by banking
or covering the fires.</p>

<p>Q. Why not turn on the feed water?</p>

<p>A. Because the crown sheet of the boiler has become
overheated, and any cold water coming upon it would
cause an explosion. If the pump or injector are running,
of course you may let them run, and the boiler will
gradually refill as the heat decreases. Under such circumstances
low water is due to overheating the boiler.</p>
<a id="Page_101" href="#Page_101" class="pagenum" title="101"> </a>

<p>Q. Would not the fusible plug avert any disaster from
low water?</p>

<p>A. It might, and it might not. The top of it is liable
to get coated with lime so that the device is worthless.
You should act at all times precisely as if there were no
fusible plug. If it ever does avert an explosion you
may be thankful, but averting explosions by taking such
means as we have suggested will be far better for an
engineer’s reputation.</p>

<p>Q. Would not the safety valve be a safeguard against
explosion?</p>

<p>A. No; only under certain conditions. It prevents
too high a pressure for accumulating in the boiler when
there is plenty of water; but when the water gets low
the safety valve may only hasten the explosion by relieving
some of the pressure and allowing superheated water
to burst suddenly into steam, thus vastly expanding instantly.</p>

<p>Q. Should water be allowed to stand in the boiler
when it is not in use?</p>

<p>A. It is better to draw it off and clean the boiler, to
prevent rusting, formation of scale, hardening of sediment,
etc., if boiler is to be left for any great length of
time.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do if a grate bar breaks or falls
out?</p>

<p>A. You should always have a spare grate bar on hand
to put in its place; but if you have none you may fill the
space by wedging in a stick of hard wood cut the right
shape to fill the opening. Cover this wood with ashes
before poking the fire over it, and it will last for several
hours before it burns out. You will find it exceedingly
difficult to keep up the fire with a big hole in the grate
that will let cold air into the furnace and allow coal to
drop down.</p>

<p>In case the grate is of the rocker type the opening
may be filled by shaping a piece of flat iron, which can
be set in without interfering with the rocking of the
grate; or the opening may be filled with wood as before
if the wood is covered well with ashes. Of course the
<a id="Page_102" href="#Page_102" class="pagenum" title="102"> </a>
use of wood will prevent the grate from rocking and the
poker must be used to clean.</p>

<p>Q. Why should an engineer never start a boiler with
a hot fire, and never let his fire get hotter than is needed
to keep up steam?</p>

<p>A. Both will cause the sheets to warp and the flues
to become leaky, because under high heat some parts of
the boiler will expand more rapidly than others. For a
similar reason, any sudden application of cold to a boiler,
either cold water or cold air through the firebox door,
will cause quicker contraction of certain parts than other
parts, and this will ruin a boiler.</p>

<p>Q. How should you supply a boiler with water?</p>

<p>A. In a regular stream continually. Only by making
the water pass regularly and gradually through the
heater will you get the full effect of the heat from the
exhaust steam. If a great deal of water is pumped into
the boiler at one time, the exhaust steam will not be sufficient
to heat it as it ought. Then if you have a full
boiler and shut off the water supply, the exhaust steam
in the heater is wasted, for it can do no work at all. Besides,
it hurts the boiler to allow the temperature to
change, as it will inevitably do if water is supplied irregularly.</p>

<p>WHATEVER YOU DO, NEVER ATTEMPT TO
TIGHTEN A SCREW OR CALK A BOILER
UNDER STEAM PRESSURE. IF ANYTHING IS
LOOSE IT IS LIABLE TO BLOW OUT IN YOUR
FACE WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p>Q. If boiler flues become leaky, can an ordinary person
tighten them?</p>

<p>A. Yes, if the work is done carefully. See full explanation
previously given, <a href="#Page_17" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;17</a>. Great care should be
taken not to expand the flues too much, for by so doing
you are likely to loosen other flues and cause more leaks
than you had in the first place. Small leaks inside a
boiler are not particularly dangerous, but they should
be remedied at the earliest possible moment, since they
<a id="Page_103" href="#Page_103" class="pagenum" title="103"> </a>
reduce the power of the boiler and put out the fire. Besides,
they look bad for the engineer.</p>

<p>Q. How should flues be cleaned?</p>

<p>A. Some use a steam blower; but a better way is
to scrape off the metal with one of the many patent
scrapers, which just fill the flue, and when attached to
a rod and worked back and forth a few times the whole
length of the flue do admirable service.</p>

<p>Q. What harm will dirty flues do?</p>

<p>A. Two difficulties arise from dirty flues. If they
become reduced in size the fire will not burn well. Then,
the same amount of heat will do far less work because it
is so much harder for it to get through the layer of soot
and ashes, which are non-conductors.</p>

<p>Q. What would you do if the throttle broke?</p>

<p>A. Use reverse lever.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">POINTS FOR THE YOUNG ENGINEER.—(CONT.)</span></h2>


<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.<br />

THE ENGINE.</h3>

<p>Q. What is the first thing to do with a new engine?</p>

<p>A. With some cotton waste or a soft rag saturated
with benzine or turpentine clean off all the bright work;
then clean every bearing, box and oil hole, using a force
pump with air current first, if you have a pump, and
then wiping the inside out clean with an oily rag, using
a wire if necessary to make the work thorough. If you
do not clean the working parts of the engine thus before
setting it up, grit will get into the bearings and cause
them to cut. Parts that have been put together need not
be taken apart; but you should clean everything you can
get at, especially the oil holes and other places that may
receive dirt during transportation.</p>

<p>After the oil holes have been well cleaned, the oil cups
may be wiped off and put in place, screwing them in with
a wrench.</p>

<p>Q. What kind of oil should you use?</p>

<p>A. Cylinder oil only for the cylinder; lard oil for the
bearings, and hard grease if your engine is provided
with hard grease cup for the cross-head and crank. The
only good substitute for cylinder oil is pure beef suet
tried out. Merchantable tallow should never be used, as
it contains acid.</p>

<p>Q. Can fittings be screwed on by hand only?</p>

<p>A. No; all fittings should be screwed up tight with
a wrench.</p>

<p>Q. When all fittings are in place, what must be done
before the engine can be started?</p>

<p>A. See that the grates in the firebox are in place and
all right; then fill the boiler with clean water until it
<a id="Page_105" href="#Page_105" class="pagenum" title="105"> </a>
shows an inch to an inch and a half in the water gauge.
Start your fire, and let it burn slowly until there is a
pressure in the boiler of 10 or 15 lbs. Then you can turn
on the blower to get up draft. In the meantime fill all
the oil cups with oil; put grease on the gears; open and
close all cocks to see that they work all right; turn your
engine over a few times to see that it works all right;
let a little steam into the cylinder with both cylinder cocks
open—just enough to show at the cocks without moving
the engine—and slowly turn the engine over, stopping
it on the dead centers to see if the steam comes from only
one of the cylinder cocks at a time, and that the proper
one; reverse the engine and make the same test. Also see
that the cylinder oiler is in place and ready for operation.
See that the pump is all right and in place, with the
valve in the feedpipe open and also the valve in the
supply pipe.</p>

<p>By going over the engine in this way you will notice
whether everything is tight and in working order, and
whether you have failed to notice any part which you do
not understand. If there is any part or fitting you do
not understand, know all about it before you go ahead.</p>

<p>Having started your fire with dry wood, add fuel gradually,
a little at a time, until you have a fire covering
every part of the grate. Regulate the fire by the damper
alone, never opening the firebox door even if the fire gets
too hot.<!--TN: added period--></p>

<p>Q. In what way should the engine be started?</p>

<p>A. When you have from 25 to 40 lbs. of pressure
open the throttle valve a little, allowing the cylinder
cocks to be open also. Some steam will condense at first
in the cold cylinder, and this water must be allowed to
drain off. See that the crank is not on a dead center,
and put on just enough steam to start the engine. As soon
as it gets warmed up, and only dry steam appears at the
cocks, close the cylinder cocks, open the throttle gradually
till it is wide open, and wait for the engine to work
up to its full speed.</p>

<p>Q. How is the speed of the engine regulated?</p>

<p>A. By the governor, which is operated by a belt running
<a id="Page_106" href="#Page_106" class="pagenum" title="106"> </a>
to the main shaft. The governor is a delicate apparatus,
and should be watched closely. It should move
up and down freely on the stem, which should not
leak steam. If it doesn’t work steadily, you should stop
the engine and adjust it, after watching it for a minute or
two to see just where the difficulty lies.</p>

<p>Q. Are you likely to have any hot boxes?</p>

<p>A. There should be none if the bearings are all clean
and well supplied with oil. However, in starting a new
engine you should stop now and then and examine
every bearing by laying your hand upon it. Remember
the eccentric, the link pin, the cross-head, the crank pin.
If there is any heat, loosen the boxes up a trifle, but
only a very little at a time. If you notice any knocking
or pounding, you have loosened too much, and should
tighten again.</p>

<p>Q. What must you do in regard to water supply?</p>

<p>A. After the engine is started and you know it is all
right, fill the tank on the engine and start the injector.
It may take some patience to get the injector started, and
you should carefully follow the directions previously
given and those which apply especially to the type of
injector used. Especially be sure that the cocks admitting
the water through the feed pipe and into the boiler
are open.</p>

<p>Q. Why are both a pump and an injector required
on an engine?</p>

<p>A. The pump is most economical, because it permits
the heat in the exhaust steam to be used to heat the feed
water, while the injector heats the water by live steam.
There should also be an injector, however, for use when
the engine is not working, in order that the water in
the boiler may be kept up with heated water. If a cross-head
pump is used, of course, it will not operate when
the engine is not running; and in case of an independent
pump the heater will not heat the water when the engine
is not running because there is little or no exhaust steam
available. There is an independent pump (the Marsh
pump) which heats the water before it goes into the
<a id="Page_107" href="#Page_107" class="pagenum" title="107"> </a>
boiler, and this may be used when the engine is shut
down instead of the injector.</p>

<p>Q. What is the next thing to test?</p>

<p>A. The reversing mechanism. Throw the reverse
lever back, and see if the engine will run equally well in
the opposite direction. Repeat this a few times to make
sure that the reverse is in good order.</p>

<p>Q. How is a traction engine set going upon the road?</p>

<p>A. Most traction engines now have the friction clutch.
When the engine is going at full speed, take hold of the
clutch lever and slowly bring the clutch against the band
wheel. It will slip a little at first, gradually engaging
the gears and moving the outfit. Hold the clutch lever
in one hand, while with the other you operate the steering
wheel. By keeping your hand on the clutch lever you
may stop forward motion instantly if anything goes
wrong. When the engine is once upon the road, the
clutch lever may set in the notch provided for it, and
the engine will go at full speed. You can then give your
entire attention to steering.</p>

<p>Q. What should you do if the engine has no friction
clutch?</p>

<p>A. Stop the engine, placing the reversing lever in the
center notch. Then slide the spur pinion into the gear
and open the throttle valve wide. You are now ready to
control the engine by the reversing lever. Throw the
lever forward a little, bringing it back, and so continue
until you have got the engine started gradually. When
well under way throw the reverse lever into the last
notch, and give your attention to steering.</p>

<p>Q. How should you steer a traction engine?</p>

<p>A. In all cases the same man should handle the throttle
and steer the engine. Skill in steering comes by practice,
and about the only rule that can be given is to go
slow, and under no circumstances jerk your engine about.
Good steering depends a great deal on natural ability to
judge distances by the eye and power by the feel. A
good engineer must have a good eye, a good ear, and
a good touch (if we may so speak). If either is wanting,
success will be uncertain.</p>
<a id="Page_108" href="#Page_108" class="pagenum" title="108"> </a>

<p>Q. How should an engine be handled on the road?</p>

<p>A. There will be no special difficulty in handling an
engine on a straight, level piece of road, especially if the
road is hard and without holes. But when you come to
your first hill your troubles will begin.</p>

<p>Before ascending a hill, see that the water in the boiler
does not stand more than two inches in the glass gauge.
If there is too much water, as it is thrown to one end
of the engine by the grade it is liable to get into the
steam cylinder. If you have too much water, blow off a
little from the bottom blow-off cock.</p>

<p>In descending a hill never stop your engine for a moment,
since your crown sheet will be uncovered by reason
of the water being thrown forward, and any cessation
in the jolting of the engine which keeps the water flowing
over the crown sheet will cause the fusible plug to
blow out, making delay and expense.</p>

<p>Make it a point never to stop your engine except on
the level.</p>

<p>Before descending a hill, shut off the steam at the
throttle, and control the engine by the friction brake; or
if there is no brake, do not quite close the throttle, but
set the reverse lever in the center notch, or back far
enough to control the speed. It is seldom necessary to
use steam in going down hill, however, and if the throttle
is closed even with no friction brake, the reverse may
be used in such a way as to form an air brake in the cylinder.</p>

<p>Get down to the bottom of a hill as quickly as you
can.</p>

<p>Before descending a hill it would be well to close your
dampers and keep the firebox door closed tight all the
time. Cover the fire with fresh fuel so as to keep the heat
down.</p>

<p>The pump or injector must be kept at work, however,
since as you have let the water down low, you must not
let it fall any lower or you are likely to have trouble.</p>

<p>In ascending a hill, do just the reverse, namely: Keep
your fire brisk and hot, with steam pressure ascending;
and throw the reverse lever in the last notch, giving the
<a id="Page_109" href="#Page_109" class="pagenum" title="109"> </a>
engine all the steam you can, else you may get stuck. If
you stop you are likely to overheat forward end of fire
tubes. You are less liable to get stuck if you go slowly
than if you go fast. Regulate speed by friction clutch.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">POINTS FOR THE YOUNG ENGINEER.—(CONT.)</span></h2>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<p>Q. What is Foaming?</p>

<p>A. The word is used to describe the rising of water
in large bubbles or foam. You will detect it by noticing
that the water in the glass gauge rises and falls, or is
foamy. It is due to sediment in the boiler, or grease
and other impurities in the feed supply. Shaking up the
boiler will start foaming sometimes; at other times it will
start without apparent cause. In such cases it is due to
the steam trying to get through a thick crust on the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>Q. How may you prevent foaming?</p>

<p>A. It may be checked for a moment by turning off
the throttle, so giving the water a chance to settle. It is
generally prevented by frequently using the surface blow-off
to clear away the scum. Of course the water must be
kept as pure as possible, and especially should alkali
water be avoided.</p>

<p>Q. What is priming?</p>

<p>A. Priming is not the same as foaming, though it is
often caused by foaming. Priming is the carrying of
water into the steam cylinder with the steam. It is
caused by various things beside foaming, for it may be
found when the boiler is quite clean. A sudden and very
hot fire may start priming. Priming sometimes follows
lowering of the steam pressure. Often it is due to lack of
capacity in the boiler, especially lack of steam space, or
lack of good circulation.</p>

<p>Q. How can you detect priming?</p>

<p>A. By the clicking sound it makes in the steam cylinder.
The water in the gauge will also go up and down
violently. There will also be a shower of water from the
exhaust.</p>
<a id="Page_111" href="#Page_111" class="pagenum" title="111"> </a>

<p>Q. What is the proper remedy for priming?</p>

<p>A. If it is due to lack of capacity in the boiler nothing
can be done but get a new boiler. In other cases it may
be remedied by carrying less water in the boiler when
that can be done safely, by taking steam from a different
point in the steam dome, or if there is no dome by using
a long dry pipe with perforation at the end.</p>

<p>A larger steam pipe may help it; or it may be remedied
by taking out the top row of flues.</p>

<p>Leaky cylinder rings or a leaky valve may also have
something to do with it. In all cases these should be
made steam tight. If the exhaust nozzle is choked up
with grease or sediment, clean it out.</p>

<p>A traction engine with small steam ports would prime
quickly under forced speed.</p>

<p>Q. How would you bank your fires?</p>

<p>A. Push the fire as far to the back of the firebox as
possible and cover it over with very fine coal or with dry
ashes. As large a portion as possible of the grate should
be left open, so that the air may pass over the fire. Close
the damper tight. By banking your fires at night you
keep the boiler warm and can get up steam more quickly
in the morning.</p>

<p>Q. When water is left in the boiler with banked fire
in cold weather, what precautions ought to be taken?</p>

<p>A. The cocks in the glass water gauge should be
closed and the drain cock at the bottom opened, for fear
the water in the exposed gauge should freeze. Likewise
all drain cocks in steam cylinder and pump should be
opened.</p>

<p>Q. How should a traction engine be prepared for
laying up during the winter?</p>

<p>A. First, the outside of the boiler and engine should
be thoroughly cleaned, seeing that all gummy oil or
grease is removed. Then give the outside of the boiler
and smokestack a coat of asphalt paint, or a coat of
lampblack and linseed oil, or at any rate a doping of
grease.</p>

<p>The outside of the boiler should be cleaned while it is
hot, so that grease, etc., may be easily removed while
soft.</p>
<a id="Page_112" href="#Page_112" class="pagenum" title="112"> </a>

<p>After the outside has been attended to, blow out the
water at low pressure and thoroughly clean the inside in
the usual way, taking out the handhole and manhole
plates, and scraping off all scale and sediment.</p>

<p>After the boiler has been cleaned on the inside, fill it
nearly full of water, and pour upon the top a bucket of
black oil. Then let the water out through the blow-off
at the bottom. As the water goes down it will have a
coating of oil down the sides of the boiler.</p>

<p>All the brass fittings should be removed, including
gauge cocks, check valves, safety valve, etc. Disconnect
all pipes that may contain water, to be sure none remains
in any of them. Open all stuffing boxes and take out
packing, for the packing will cause the parts they surround
to rust.</p>

<p>Finally, clean out the inside of the firebox and the fire
flues, and give the ash-pan a good coat of paint all over,
inside as well as out.</p>

<p>The inside of the cylinder should be well greased,
which can be done by removing the cylinder head.</p>

<p>See that the top of the smoke stack is covered to keep
out the weather.</p>

<p>All brass fittings should be carefully packed and put
away in a dry place.</p>

<p>A little attention to the engine when you put it up will
save twice as much time when you take it out next season,
and besides save many dollars of value in the life of
the engine.</p>

<p>Q. How should belting be cared for?</p>

<p>A. First, keep belts free from dust and dirt.</p>

<p>Never overload belts.</p>

<p>Do not let oil or grease drip upon them.</p>

<p>Never put any sticky or pasty grease on a belt.</p>

<p>Never allow any animal oil or grease to touch a rubber
belt, since it will destroy the life of the rubber.</p>

<p>The grain or hair side should run next the pulley, as it
holds better and is not so likely to slip.</p>

<p>Rubber belts will be greatly improved if they are covered
with a mixture of black lead and litharge, equal
parts, mixed with boiled oil, and just enough japan to
<a id="Page_113" href="#Page_113" class="pagenum" title="113"> </a>
dry them quickly. This mixture will do to put on places
that peel.</p>

<p>Q. What is the proper way to lace a belt?</p>

<p>A. First, square the ends with a proper square, cutting
them off to a nicety. Begin to lace in the middle,
and do not cross the laces on the pulley side. On that
side the lacings should run straight with the length of
the belt.</p>

<p>The holes in the belt should be punched if possible with
an oval punch, the long diameter coinciding with the
length of the belt. Make two rows of holes in each end
of the belt, so that the holes in each row will alternate
with those in preceding row, making a zigzag. Four
holes will be required for a three-inch belt in each end,
two holes in each row; in a six-inch belt, place seven
holes in each end, four in the row nearest the end.</p>

<p>To find the length of a belt when the exact length cannot
be measured conveniently, measure a straight line from
the center of one pulley to the center of the other. Add
together half the diameter of each pulley, and multiply
that by 3¼ (3.1416)<!--TN: as printed-->. The result added to twice the
distance between the centers will give the total length of
the belt.</p>

<p>A belt will work best if it is allowed to sag just a
trifle.</p>

<p>The seam side of a rubber belt should be placed outward,
or away from the pulley.</p>

<p>If such a belt slips, coat the inside with boiled linseed
oil or soap.</p>

<p>Cotton belting may be preserved by painting the pulley
side while running with common paint, afterward applying
soft oil or grease.</p>

<p>If a belt slips apply a little oil or soap to the pulley
side.</p>

<p>Q. How does the capacity of belts vary?</p>

<p>A. In proportion to width and also to the speed.
Double the width and you double the capacity; also,
within a certain limit, double the speed and you double
the capacity. A belt should not be run over 5,000 feet
per minute. One four-inch belt will have the same capacity
as two two-inch belts.</p>
<a id="Page_114" href="#Page_114" class="pagenum" title="114"> </a>

<p>Q. How are piston rods and valve rods packed so
that the steam cannot escape around them?</p>

<p>A. By packing placed in stuffing-boxes. The stuffing
is of some material that has a certain amount of
elasticity, such as lamp wick, hemp, soap stone, etc., and
certain patent preparations. The packing is held in place
by a gland, as it is called, which acts to tighten the packing
as the cap of the stuffing-box is screwed up.</p>

<p>Q. How would you repack a stuffing-box?</p>

<p>A. First remove the cap and the gland, and with a
proper tool take out all the old packing. Do not use any
rough instrument like a file, which is liable to scratch the
rod, for any injury to the smooth surface of the rod
will make it leak steam or work hard.</p>

<p>If patent packing is used, cut off a sufficient number
of lengths to make the required rings. They should be
exactly the right length to go around inside the stuffing-box.
If too long, they cannot be screwed up tight, as the
ends will press together and cause irregularities. If too
short, the ends will not meet and will leak steam. Cut
the ends diagonally so that they will make a lap joint instead
of a square one. When the stuffing-box has been
filled, place the gland in position and screw up tight.
Afterwards loosen the nuts a trifle, as the steam will
cause the packing to expand, usually. The stuffing-box
should be just as loose as it can be and not allow leakage
of steam. If steam leaks, screw up the box a little
tighter. If it still leaks, do not screw up as tight as you
possibly can, but repack the box. If the stuffing-box is
too tight, either for the piston rod or valve steam, it will
cause the engine to work hard, and may groove the rods
and spoil them.</p>

<p>If hemp packing is used, pull the fibres out straight
and free, getting rid of all knots and lumps. Twist together
a few of the fibres, making three cords, and braid
these three cords together and soak them with oil or
grease, wind around the rod till stuffing-box is sufficiently
full, replace the gland, and screw up as before.</p>

<p>Stuffing-box for water piston of pump may be packed
as described above, but little oil or grease will be needed.</p>
<a id="Page_115" href="#Page_115" class="pagenum" title="115"> </a>

<p>Never pack the stuffing-box too tight, or you may flute
the rod and spoil it.</p>

<p>Always keep the packing in a clean place, well covered
up, never allowing any dust to get into it, for the dust
or grit is liable to cut the rod.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">ECONOMY IN RUNNING A FARM ENGINE.</span></h2>


<p>It is something to be able to run a farm engine and
keep out of trouble. It is even a great deal if everything
runs smoothly day in and day out, if the engine
looks clean, and you can always develop the amount of
power you need. You must be able to do this before you
can give the fine points of engineering much consideration.</p>

<p>When you come to the point where you are always able
to keep out of trouble, you are probably ready to learn
how you can make your engine do more work on less
fuel than it does at present. In that direction the best
of us have an infinite amount to learn. It is a fact that
in an ordinary farm engine only about 4 per cent of the
coal energy is actually saved and used for work; the rest
is lost, partly in the boiler, more largely in the engine.
So we see what a splendid chance there is to save.</p>

<p>If we are asked where all the lost energy goes to, we
might reply in a general sort of way, a good deal goes
up the smokestack in smoke or unused fuel; some is radiated
from the boiler in the form of heat and is lost
without producing any effect on the steam within the
boiler; some is lost in the cooling of the steam as it
passes to the steam cylinder; some is lost in the cooling
of the cylinder itself after each stroke; some is lost
through the pressure on the back of the steam valve,
causing a friction that requires a good deal of energy
in the engine to overcome; some is lost in friction in the
bearings, stuffing-boxes, etc. At each of these points
economy may be practiced if the engineer knows how to
do it. We offer a few suggestions.</p>


<h3>THEORY OF STEAM POWER.</h3>

<p>As economy is a scientific question, we cannot study
it intelligently without knowing something of the theory
<a id="Page_117" href="#Page_117" class="pagenum" title="117"> </a>
of heat, steam and the transmission of power. There
will be nothing technical in the following pages; and as
soon as the theory is explained in simple language, any
intelligent person will know for himself just what he
ought to do in any given case.</p>

<p>First, let us define or describe heat according to the
scientific theory. Scientists suppose that all matter is
made up of small particles called molecules, so small that
they have never been seen. Each molecule is made up of
still smaller particles called atoms. There is nothing
smaller than an atom, and there are only about sixty-five
different kinds of atoms, which are called elements; or
rather, any substance made up of only one kind of atom
is called an element. Thus iron is an element, and so is
zinc, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. But a substance like water
is not an element, but a compound, since its molecules are
made up of an atom of oxygen united with two atoms of
hydrogen. Wood is made up of many different kinds of
atoms united in various ways. Air is not a compound,
but a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and a few other substances
in small quantities.</p>

<p>The reason why air is a mixture and not a compound
is an interesting one, and brings us to our next point.
In order to form a compound, two different kinds of
atoms must have an attraction for each other. There is
no attraction between oxygen and nitrogen; but there is
great attraction between oxygen and carbon, and when
they get a chance they rush together like long separated
lovers<!--TN: was 'overs'-->. Anthracite coal is almost pure carbon. So is charcoal.
Soft coal consists of carbon with which various
other things are united, one of them being hydrogen.
This is interesting and important, because it accounts for
a curious thing in firing up boilers with soft coal. We
have already said that water is oxygen united with hydrogen.
When soft coal burns, not only does the carbon
unite with oxygen, but the hydrogen unites with oxygen
and forms water, or steam. While the boilers are cold
they will condense the water or steam in the smoke, just
as a cold plate in a steamy room will condense water from
the steamy air, so sweating.</p>

<p>Now the scientists suppose that two or three atoms
<a id="Page_118" href="#Page_118" class="pagenum" title="118"> </a>
stick together by reason of their attraction for each other
and form molecules. These molecules in turn stick together
and form liquids and solids. The tighter they
stick, the harder the substance. At the same time, these
molecules are more or less loose, and are constantly moving
back and forth. In a solid like iron they move very
little; but a current of electricity through iron makes the
molecules move in a peculiar way. In a liquid like water,
the molecules cling together very loosely, and may easily
be pulled apart. In any gas, like air or steam, the molecules
are entirely disconnected, and are constantly trying
to get farther apart.</p>

<p>Heat, says the scientist, is nothing more or less than
the movement of the molecules back and forth. Heat up
a piece of iron in a hot furnace, and the molecules keep
getting further and further apart, and the iron gets softer
and softer, till it becomes a liquid. If we take some liquid
like water and heat it, the molecules get farther and farther
apart, till the water boils, as we say, or turns into
steam. As steam the molecules have broken apart entirely,
and are beating back and forth so rapidly that they
have a tendency to push each other farther and farther
apart. This pushing tendency is the cause of steam pressure.
It also explains why steam has an expansive
power.</p>

<p>Heat, then, is the movement of the molecules back and
forth. There are three fixed ranges in which they move;
the small range makes a solid; the next range makes a
liquid; the third range makes a gas, such as steam. These
three states of matter as affected by heat are very sharp
and definite. The point at which a solid turns to a liquid
is called the melting point. The melting point of ice is
32° Fahr. The point at which it turns to a gas is called
the boiling point. With water that is 212° Fahr. The
general tendency of heat is to push apart, or expand;
and when the heat is taken away the substances contract.</p>

<p>Let us consider our steam boiler. We saw that some
different kinds of atoms have a strong tendency to rush
together; for example, oxygen and carbon. The air is
full of oxygen, and coal and wood are full of carbon.
When they are raised to a certain temperature, and
<a id="Page_119" href="#Page_119" class="pagenum" title="119"> </a>
the molecules get loose enough so that they can tear
themselves away from whatever they are attached to,
they rush together with terrible force, which sets all
surrounding molecules to vibrating faster than ever. This
means that heat is given out.</p>

<p>Another important thing is that when a solid changes
to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas, it must take up a certain
amount of heat to keep the molecules always just so far
apart. That heat is said to become latent, for it will not
show in a thermometer, it will not cause anything to expand,
nor will it do any work. It merely serves to hold
the molecules just so far apart.</p>


<h3>HOW ENERGY IS LOST.</h3>

<p>We may now see some of the ways in which energy is
lost. First, the air which goes into the firebox consists
of nitrogen as well as oxygen. That nitrogen is only in
the way, and takes heat from the fire, which it carries
out at the smokestack.</p>

<p>Again, if the air cannot get through the bed of coals
easily enough, or there is not enough of it so that every
atom of carbon, etc., will find the right number of atoms
of oxygen, some of the atoms of carbon will be torn off
and united with oxygen, and the other atoms of carbon,
left without any oxygen to unite with, will go floating out
at the smokestack as black smoke. Also, the carbon
and the oxygen cannot unite except at a certain temperature,
and when fresh fuel is thrown on the fire it is cold,
and a good many atoms of carbon after being loosened
up, get cooled off again before they have a chance to
find an atom of oxygen, and so they, too, go floating off
and are lost.</p>

<p>If the smoke could be heated up, and there were
enough oxygen mixed with it, the loose carbon would
still burn and produce heat, and there would be an economy
of fuel. This has given rise to smoke consumers, and
arranging two boilers, so that when one is being fired the
heat from the other will catch the loose carbon before it
gets away and burn it up.</p>

<p>So we have these points:</p>

<p>1. Enough oxygen or air must get into a furnace so
<a id="Page_120" href="#Page_120" class="pagenum" title="120"> </a>
that every atom of carbon will have its atom of oxygen.
This means that you must have a good draft and that the
air must have a chance to get through the coal or other
fuel.</p>

<p>2. The fuel must be kept hot enough all the time so
that the carbon and oxygen can unite. Throwing on too
much cold fuel at one time will lower the heat beyond the
economical point and cause loss in thick smoke.</p>

<p>3. If the smoke can pass over a hot bed of coals, or
through a hot chamber, the carbon in it may still be
burned. This suggests putting fuel at the front of the
firebox, a little at a time, so that its smoke will have to
pass over a hot bed of coals and the waste carbon will
be burned. When the fresh fuel gets heated up, it may
be pushed farther back.</p>

<p>From a practical point of view these points mean, No
dead plates in a furnace to keep the air from going
through coal or wood; a thin fire so the air can get
through easily; place the fresh fuel where its smoke will
have a chance to be burned; and do not cool off the furnace
by putting on much fresh fuel at a time.</p>

<p>(Later we will give more hints on firing.)</p>


<h3>HOW HEAT IS DISTRIBUTED.</h3>

<p>We have described heat as the movement of molecules
back and forth at a high rate of speed. If these heated
molecules beat against a solid like iron, its molecules are
set in motion, one knocks the next, and so on, just as you
push one man in a crowd, he pushes the next, and so on
till the push comes out on the other side. So heat passes
through iron and appears on the other side. This is
called “conduction.”</p>

<p>All space is supposed to be filled with a substance in
which heat, light, etc., may be transmitted, called the
ether. When the molecules of a sheet of iron are heated,
or set vibrating, they transmit the vibration through the
air, or ether. This is called “radiation.” Heat is “conducted”
through solid and liquid substances, and “radiated”
through gases.</p>

<p>Now some substances conduct heat readily, and some
do so with the greatest difficulty. Iron is a good conductor;
<a id="Page_121" href="#Page_121" class="pagenum" title="121"> </a>
carbon, or soot on the flues of a boiler, and lime
or scale on the inside of a boiler, are very poor conductors.
So the heat will go through the iron and steel
to the water in a boiler quickly and easily, and a large per
cent of the heat of the furnace will get to the water in a
boiler. When a boiler is old and is clogged with soot
and coated with lime, the heat cannot get through easily,
and goes off in the smokestack. The air coming out of
the smokestack will be much hotter; and that extra heat
is lost.</p>

<p>Iron is a good radiator, too. So if the outer shell of a
boiler is exposed to the air, a great deal of heat will run
off into space and be lost. Here, then, is where you need
a non-conductor, as it is called, such as lime, wood, or
the like.</p>

<p>Economy says, cover the outside of a boiler shell with
a non-conductor. This may be brickwork in a set boiler;
in a traction boiler it means a jacket of wood, plaster,
hair, or the like. The steam pipe, if it passes through
outer air, should be covered with felt; and the steam
cylinder ought to have its jacket, too.</p>

<p>At the same time all soot and all scale should be scrupulously
cleaned away.</p>


<h3>PROPERTIES OF STEAM.</h3>

<p>As we have already seen, steam is a gas. It is slightly
blue in color, just as the water in the ocean is blue, or the
air in the sky.</p>

<p>We must distinguish between steam and vapor. Vapor
is small particles of water hanging in the air. They seem
to stick to the molecules composing the air, or hang there
in minute drops. Water hanging in the air is, of course,
water still. Its molecules do not have the movement that
the molecules of a true gas do, such as steam is. Steam,
moreover, has absorbed latent heat, and has expansive
force; but vapor has no latent heat, and no expansive
force. So vapor is dead and lifeless, while steam is live
and full of energy to do work.</p>

<p>When vapor gets mixed with steam it is only in the
way; it is a sort of dead weight that must be carried;
<a id="Page_122" href="#Page_122" class="pagenum" title="122"> </a>
and the steam power is diminished by having vapor mixed
with it.</p>

<p>Now all steam as it bubbles up through water in boiling
takes up with it a certain amount of vapor. Such
steam is called “wet” steam. When the vapor is no
longer in it, the steam is called “dry” steam. It is dry
steam that does the best work, and that every engineer
wants to get.</p>

<p>While water will be taken up to great heights in the
air and form clouds, in steam it will not rise very
much, and at a certain height above the level of the water
in a boiler the steam will be much drier than near the
surface. For this reason steam domes have been devised,
so that the steam may be taken out at a point as high as
possible above the water in the boiler, and so be as dry
as possible. Also “dry tubes” have been devised, which
let the steam pass through many small holes that serve
to keep back the water to a certain extent.</p>

<p>However, there will be more or less moisture in all
steam until it has been superheated, as it is called. This
may be done by passing it through the hot part of the
furnace, where the added heat will turn all the moisture
in the steam into steam, and we shall have perfectly dry
steam.</p>

<p>The moment, however, that steam goes through a cold
pipe, or one cooled by radiation, or goes into a cold
cylinder, or a cylinder cooled by radiation, some of the
steam will turn to water, or condense, as it is called. So
we have the same trouble again.</p>

<p>Much moisture passing into the cylinder with the steam
is called “priming.” In that case the dead weight of
water has become so great as to kill a great part of the
steam power.</p>


<h3>HOW TO USE THE EXPANSIVE POWER OF STEAM.</h3>

<p>We have said that the molecules in steam are always
trying to get farther and farther apart. If they are free
in the air, they will soon scatter; but if they are confined
in a boiler or cylinder they merely push out in every
direction, forming “pressure.”</p>
<a id="Page_123" href="#Page_123" class="pagenum" title="123"> </a>

<p>When steam is let into the cylinder it has the whole
accumulated pressure in the boiler behind it, and of course
that exerts a strong push on the piston. Shut off the
boiler pressure and the steam in the cylinder will still
have its own natural tendency to expand. As the space
in the cylinder grows larger with the movement of the
piston from end to end, the expansive power of the steam
becomes less and less, of course. However, every little
helps, and the push this lessened expansive force exerts
on the piston is so much energy saved. If the full boiler
pressure is kept on the piston the whole length of the
stroke, and then the exhaust port is immediately opened,
all this expansive energy of the steam is lost. It escapes
through the exhaust nozzle into the smokestack and is
gone. Possibly it cannot get out quickly enough, and
causes back pressure on the cylinder when the piston
begins its return stroke, so reducing the power of the
engine.</p>

<p>To save this the skilled engineer “notches up” his reverse
lever, as they say. The reverse lever controls the
valve travel. When the lever is in the last notch the
valve has its full travel. When the lever is in the center
notch the valve has no travel at all, and no steam can
get into the cylinder; on the other side the lever allows
the valve to travel gradually more and more in the opposite
direction, so reversing the engine.</p>

<p>As the change from one direction to the other direction
is, of course, gradual, the valve movement is shortened
by degrees, and lets steam into the cylinder for a correspondingly
less time. At its full travel it perhaps lets
steam into the cylinder for three-quarters of its stroke.
For the last quarter the work is done by the expansive
power of the steam.</p>

<p>Set the lever in the half notch, and the travel of the
valve is so altered that steam can get into the cylinder
only during half the stroke of the piston, the work during
the rest of the stroke being done by the expansive force
of the steam.</p>

<p>Set the lever in the notch next to the middle notch, or
the quarter notch, and steam will get into the cylinder
<a id="Page_124" href="#Page_124" class="pagenum" title="124"> </a>
only during a quarter of the stroke of the piston, the
work being done during three-quarters of the stroke by
the expansive force of the steam.</p>

<p>Obviously the more the steam is expanded the less
work it can do. But when it escapes at the exhaust
there will be very little pressure to be carried away
and lost.</p>

<p>Therefore when the load on his engine is light the
economical engineer will “notch up” his engine with the
reverse lever, and will use up correspondingly less steam
and save correspondingly more fuel. When the load is
unusually heavy, however, he will have to use the full
power of the pressure in the boiler, and the waste cannot
be helped.</p>


<h3>THE COMPOUND ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The compound engine is an arrangement of steam
cylinders to save the expansive power of steam at all
times by letting the steam from one cylinder where it is
at high pressure into another after it exhausts from the
first, in this second cylinder doing more work purely by
the expansive power of the steam.</p>

<p>The illustration shows a sectional view of a compound
engine having two cylinders, one high pressure
and one low. The low pressure cylinder is much larger
than the high pressure. There is a single plate between
them called the center head, and the same piston rod is
fitted with two pistons, one for each cylinder. The
steam chest does not receive steam from the boiler, but
from the exhaust of the high pressure cylinder. The
steam from the boiler goes into a chamber in the double
valve, from which it passes to the ports of the high
pressure cylinder. At the return stroke the exhaust
steam escapes into the steam chest, and from there it
passes into the low pressure cylinder. There may be
one valve riding on the back of another; but the simplest
form of compound engine is built with a single double
valve, which opens and closes the ports for both cylinders
at one movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_125">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="550" height="311" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>WOOLF TANDEM CYLINDER.</p>
<a class="enlarge" href="images/i_125-large.jpg">[enlarge]</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>Theoretically the compound engine should effect a
<a id="Page_125" href="#Page_125" class="pagenum" title="125"> </a>
genuine economy. In practice there are many things to
operate against this. Of course if the steam pressure
is low to start with, the amount of pressure lost in the
exhaust will be small. But if it is very high, the saving
<a id="Page_126" href="#Page_126" class="pagenum" title="126"> </a>
in the low pressure cylinder will be relatively large. If
the work can be done just as well with a low pressure, it
would be a practical waste to keep the pressure abnormally
high in order to make the most of the compound
engine.</p>

<p>An engine must be a certain size before the saving
of a compound cylinder will be appreciable. In these
days nearly all very large engines are compound, while
small engines are simple.</p>

<p>Another consideration to be taken into account is that
a compound is more complicated and so harder to manage;
and when any unfavorable condition causes loss it
causes proportionately more loss on a compound than on
a simple engine. For these and other reasons compound
engines have been used less for traction purposes than
simple engines have. It is probable that a skilled and
thoroughly competent engineer, who would manage his
engine in a scientific manner, would get more out of a
compound than out of a simple; and this would be especially
true in regions where fuel is high. If fuel is cheap
and the engineer unskilled, a compound engine would
be a poor economizer.</p>


<h3>FRICTION.</h3>

<p>We have seen that the molecules of water have a
tendency to stick in the steam as vapor or moisture. All
molecules that are brought into close contact have more or
less tendency to stick together, and this is called friction.
The steam as it passes along the steam pipe is checked to
a certain extent by the friction on the sides of the pipe.
Friction causes heat, and it means that the heat caused
has been taken from some source of energy. The friction
of the steam diminishes the energy of the steam.</p>

<p>So, too, the fly wheel moving against the air suffers
friction with the air, besides having to drive particles of
air out of its path. All the moving parts of an engine
where one metal moves on another suffer friction, since
where the metals are pressed very tightly together they
have more tendency to stick than when not pressed so
tightly. When iron is pressed too tightly, as under the
<a id="Page_127" href="#Page_127" class="pagenum" title="127"> </a>
blows of a hammer in a soft state, it actually welds together
solidly.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of friction in the steam cylinder,
since the packing rings must press hard against the walls
of the cylinder to prevent the steam from getting through.
There is a great deal of friction between the D valve and
its seat, because of the high steam pressure on the back
of the valve. There is friction in the stuffing boxes both
of the valve and the piston. There is friction at all the
bearings.</p>

<p>There are various ways in which friction may be reduced.
The most obvious is to adjust all parts so nicely
that they will bind as little as possible. The stuffing-boxes
will be no tighter than is necessary to prevent
leaking of steam; and so with the piston rings. Journal
boxes will be tight enough to prevent pounding, but no
tighter. To obtain just the right adjustment requires
great patience and the keen powers of observation and
judgment.</p>

<p>The makers of engines try to reduce friction as much
as possible by using anti-friction metals in the boxes.
Iron and steel have to be used in shafts, gears, etc., because
of the strength that they possess; but there are
some metals that stick to each other and to iron and steel
much less than iron or steel stick to each other when
pressed close together. These metals are more or less
soft; but they may be used in boxes and journal bearings.
They are called anti-friction metals. The hardest for
practical purposes is brass, and brass is used where there
is much wear. Where there is less wear various alloys
of copper, tin, zinc, etc., may be used in the boxes. One
of these is babbit metal, which is often used in the main
journal box.</p>

<p>All these anti-friction metals wear out rapidly, and
they must be put in so that they can be adjusted or renewed
easily.</p>

<p>But the great anti-friction agent is oil.</p>

<p>Oil is peculiar in that while the molecules seem to stick
tightly together and to a metal like iron or steel, they roll
around upon each other with the utmost ease. An ideal
<a id="Page_128" href="#Page_128" class="pagenum" title="128"> </a>
lubricator is one that sticks so tight to the journal that it
forms a sort of cushion all around it, and prevents any
of its molecules coming into contact with the molecules
of the metal box. All the friction then takes place between
the different molecules of oil, and this friction is
a minimum.</p>

<p>The same principle has been applied to mechanics in
the ball bearing. A number of little balls roll around
between the journal and its box, preventing the two
metals from coming into contact with each other; while
the balls, being spheres, touch each other only at a single
point, and the total space at which sticking can occur is
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>As is well known, there is great difference in oils.
Some evaporate, like gasoline and kerosene, and so disappear
quickly. Others do not stick tightly to the journal,
so are easily forced out of place, and the metals are
allowed to come together. What is wanted, then, is a
heavy, sticky oil that will not get hard, but will always
form a good cushion between bearings.</p>

<p>Steam cylinders cannot be oiled directly, but the oil
must be carried to the steam chest and cylinder in the
steam. A good cylinder oil must be able to stand a high
temperature. While it is diffused easily in the steam, it
must stick tightly to the walls of the steam cylinder and
to the valve seat, and keep them lubricated. Once it is
stuck to the metal, the heat of the steam should not
evaporate it and carry it away.</p>

<p>Again, a cylinder oil should not have any acid in it
which would have a tendency to corrode the metal.
Nearly all animal fats do have some such acid. So tallow
and the like should not be placed where they can corrode
iron or steel. Lard and suet alone are suitable for use
on an engine.</p>

<p>When it comes to lubricating traction gears, other
problems appear. A heavy grease will stick to the gears
and prevent them from cutting; but it will stick equally
to all sand and grit that may come along, and that, working
between the cogs, may cut them badly. So some
<a id="Page_129" href="#Page_129" class="pagenum" title="129"> </a>
engineers recommend the use on gears of an oil that does
not gather so much dirt.</p>

<p>The friction of the valve on its seat due to the pressure
of the steam on its back has given rise to many
inventions for counteracting it. The most obvious of
these is what is called “the balanced valve.” In the
compound engine, where the steam pressure is obtained
upon both sides of the valve, it rides much more lightly
on its seat—so lightly, indeed, that when steam pressure
is low, as in going down hill or operating under a light
load, plunger pistons must be used to keep the valve
down tight on its seat.</p>

<p>The poppet valves were devised to obviate the undue
friction of the D valve; but the same loss of energy
is to a certain extent transferred, and the practical saving
is not always equal to the theoretical. On large
stationary engines rotary valves and other forms, such
as are used on the Corliss engine, have come into common
use; but they are too complicated for a farm engine,
which must be as simple as possible, with least possible
liability of getting out of order.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">ECONOMY IN RUNNING A FARM ENGINE.—(CONT.)</span></h2>


<h3>PRACTICAL POINTS.</h3>

<p>The first practical point in the direction of farm engine
economy is to note that the best work can be done only
when every part of the engine and boiler are in due proportion.
If the power is in excess of the work to be done
there is loss; if the grate surface is too large cold air gets
through the fuel and prevents complete combustion, and
if the grate surface is too small, not enough air gets in;
if the steaming power of the boiler is too large, heat is radiated
away that otherwise could be saved, for every foot of
exposed area in the boiler is a source of loss; if the steaming
power of the boiler is too low for the work to be
done, it requires extra fuel to force the boiler to do its
work, and any forcing means comparatively large loss
or waste. It will be seen that not only must the engine
and boiler be built with the proper proportions, but
they must be bought with a nice sense of proportion to
the work expected of them. This requires excellent
judgment and some experience in measuring work in
horsepowers.</p>


<h3>GRATE SURFACE AND FUEL.</h3>

<p>The grate surface in a firebox should be not less than
two-thirds of a square foot per horsepower, for average
size traction engines. If the horsepower of an engine is
small, proportionately more grate surface will be needed;
if it is large, the grate surface may be proportionately
much smaller. An engine boiler 7×8×200 rev., with 100 lbs.
pressure, should have a grate<!--TN: was 'great'--> surface not less than six
square feet, and seven would be better. In a traction engine
there is always a tendency to make the grate surface
as small as possible, so that the engine will not be
cumbersome.</p>
<a id="Page_131" href="#Page_131" class="pagenum" title="131"> </a>

<p>Another reason why the grate surface should be sufficiently
large is that forced draft is a bad thing, since
it has a tendency to carry the products of combustion and
hot gases through the smokestack and out into space before
they have time to complete combustion and especially
before the heat of the gases has time to be absorbed
by the boiler surface. A large grate surface, then, with
a moderate draft, is the most economical.</p>

<p>The draft depends on other things, however. If a
great deal of fine fuel is thrown on a fire, the air must
be forced through, because it cannot get through in the
natural way. This results in waste. So a fire should be
as open as possible. Coal should be “thin” on the grates;
wood should be thrown in so that there will be plenty of
air spaces; straw should be fed in just so that it will burn
up completely as it goes in. Moderate size coal is better
than small or fine. Dust in coal checks the draft. A
good engineer will choose his fuel and handle his fire so
that he can get along with as little forced draft as possible.</p>

<p>In a straw burning engine a good circulation of air can
be obtained, if the draft door is just below the straw funnel,
by extending the funnel into the furnace six inches
or so. This keeps the straw from clogging up the place
where the air enters and enables it to get at the fuel so
much more freely that the combustion is much more complete.</p>

<p>We have already suggested that in firing with coal, the
fresh fuel be deposited in front, so that the smoke will
have to pass over live coals and so the combustion will
be more complete. Then when the coal is well lighted it
can be poked back over the other portions of the grate.
This method has another advantage, in that the first heating
is usually sufficient to separate the pure coal from the
mineral substances which form clinkers, and most of the
clinkers will be deposited at that one point in the grate.
Here they can easily be lifted out, and will not seriously
interfere with the burning of the coal as they would if
scattered all over the grate. Clinkers in front can easily
be taken out by hooking the poker over them toward the
back of the firebox and pulling them up and to the front.
<a id="Page_132" href="#Page_132" class="pagenum" title="132"> </a>
They often come out as one big mass which can be easily
lifted out.</p>

<p>The best time to clean the grate is when there is a good
brisk fire. Then it will not cause steam to go down.
Stirring a fire does little good. For one thing, it breaks
up the clinkers and allows them to run down on the grate
bars when they stick and finally warp the bars. If
the fire is not stirred the clinkers can be lifted
out in large masses. Stirring a fire also creates a tendency
to choke up or coke, and interferes with the even
and regular combustion of the coal at all points.</p>

<p>The highest heat that can be produced is a yellow
heat. When there is a good yellow heat, forced draft will
only carry off the heat and cause waste. It will not cause
still more rapid combustion. When the heat is merely
red, increased draft will raise the temperature. Combustion
is not complete until the flame shows yellow. However,
if the draft is slight and time is given, red heat will
be nearly as effective, but it will not carry the heated
gases over so large a part of the heating surface of the
boiler. With a very large grate surface, red heat will do
very well. Certainly it will be better than a forced draft,
or an effort at heating beyond the yellow point.</p>


<h3>BOILER HEATING SURFACE.</h3>

<p>The heat of the furnace does its work only as the
heated gases touch the boiler surface. The iron conducts
the heat through to the water, which is raised to the boiling
point and turned into steam.</p>

<p>Now the amount of heat that the boiler will take up
is directly in proportion to the amount of exposed surface
and to the time of exposure. If the boiler heating
surface is small, and the draft is forced so that the gases
pass through rapidly, they do not have a chance to communicate
much heat.</p>

<p>Also if the heating surface is too large, so that it cannot
all be utilized, the part not used becomes a radiating
surface, and the efficiency of the boiler is impaired.</p>

<p>Practice has shown that the amount of heating surface
practically required by a boiler is 12 to 15 square feet per
<a id="Page_133" href="#Page_133" class="pagenum" title="133"> </a>
horsepower. In reckoning heating surface, all area which
the heated gases touch is calculated.</p>

<p>Another point in regard to heating surface in the production
of steam is this, that only such surface as is exposed
to a heat equal to turning the water into steam is
effective. If there is a pressure of 150 lbs. the temperature
at which the water would turn to steam would be 357
degrees, and any gases whose temperature was below
357 degrees would have no effect on the heating surface
except to prevent radiation. Thus in a return flue boiler
the heated gases become cooled often to such an extent
before they pass out at the smokestack that they do not
help the generation of steam. Yet a heat just below 357
degrees would turn water into steam under 149 lbs. pressure.
Though it has work in it, the heat is lost.</p>

<p>Another practical point as to economy in large heating
surface is that it costs money to make, and is cumbersome
to move about. It may cost more to move a traction
engine with large boiler from place to place than the saving
in fuel would amount to. So the kind of roads and the
cost of fuel must be taken into account and nicely balanced.</p>

<p>However, it may be said that a boiler with certain outside
dimensions that will generate 20 horsepower will be
more economical than one of the same size that will generate
only 10 horsepower. In selecting an engine, the
higher the horsepower for the given dimensions, the more
economical of both fuel and water.</p>

<p>The value of heating surface also depends on the material
through which the heat must penetrate, and the
rapidity with which the heat will pass. We have already
pointed out that soot and lime scale permit heat to pass
but slowly and if they are allowed to accumulate will
greatly reduce the steaming power of a boiler for a given
consumption of fuel. Another point is that the thinner
the iron or steel, the better will the heat get through
even that. So it follows that flues, being thinner, are better
conductors than the sides of the firebox. Long flues
are better than short ones in that the long ones allow less
soot, etc., to accumulate than the short ones do, and afford
<a id="Page_134" href="#Page_134" class="pagenum" title="134"> </a>
more time for the boiler to absorb the heat of the
gases.</p>

<p>Again, we have stated that heating surface is valuable
only as it is exposed to the gases at a sufficiently high
temperature. Some boilers have a tendency to draw the
hot gases most rapidly through the upper flues, while the
lower flues do not get their proportion of the heat. This
results in a loss, for the heat to give its full benefit should
be equally distributed.</p>

<p>To prevent the heat being drawn too rapidly through
upper flues, a baffle plate may be placed in the smoke
box just above the upper flues, thus preventing them from
getting so much of the draft.</p>

<p>Again, if the exhaust nozzle is too low down, the draft
through the lower flues may be greater than through the
upper. This is remedied by putting a piece of pipe on the
exhaust to raise it higher in the smokestack.</p>


<h3>EXPANSION AND CONDENSATION.</h3>

<p>We have already pointed out that economy results if
we hook up the reverse lever so that the expansive force
of the steam has an opportunity to work during half or
three-quarters of the stroke.</p>

<p>One difficulty arising from this method is that the
walls of the cylinder cool more rapidly when not under
the full boiler pressure. Condensation in the cylinder is
a practical difficulty which should be met and overcome
as far as possible.</p>

<p>High speed gives some advantage. A judicious use
of cushion helps condensation somewhat also, because
when any gas like steam or air is compressed, it gives
off heat, and this heat in the cushion will keep up the
temperature of the cylinder. This cannot be carried very
far, however, for the back pressure of cushion will reduce
the energy of the engine movement.</p>


<h3>LEAD AND CLEARANCE.</h3>

<p>Too much clearance will detract from the power of an
engine, as there is just so much more waste space to be
filled with hot steam. Too little clearance will cause
pounding.</p>
<a id="Page_135" href="#Page_135" class="pagenum" title="135"> </a>

<p>Likewise there will be loss of power in an engine if
the lead is too great or too little. The proper amount of
lead differs with conditions. A high speed engine requires
more than a low speed, and if an engine is adjusted
for a certain speed, it should be kept uniformly
at that speed, as variation causes loss. The more clearance
an engine has the more lead it needs. Also the
quicker the valve motion, the less lead required. Sometimes
when a large engine is pulling only a light load
and there is no chance to shorten the cut-off, a turn of
the eccentric disk for a trifle more lead will effect some
economy.</p>

<p>Cut-off should be as sharp as possible. A slow cut-off
in reducing pressure before cut-off is complete, causes a
loss of power in the engine.</p>


<h3>THE EXHAUST.</h3>

<p>If the exhaust from the cylinder does not begin before
the piston begins its return stroke, there will be back
pressure due to the slowness with which the valve opens.
The exhaust should be earlier in proportion to the slowness
of the valve motion, and also, in proportion to the
speed of the engine, since the higher the speed the less
time there is for the steam to get out. It follows that an
engine whose exhaust is arranged for a low speed cannot
be run at a high speed without causing loss from
back pressure.</p>

<p>In using steam expansively the relative proportion between
the back pressure and the force of the steam is of
course greater. So in using steam expansively the back
pressure must be at a minimum, and this is especially
true in the compound engine. So many things affect
this, that it becomes one of the reasons why it is hard
to use a compound engine with as great economy as theory
would indicate.</p>

<p>Another thing, the smallness of the exhaust nozzle in
the smokestack affects the back pressure. The smaller
the nozzle, the greater the draft a given amount of steam
will create; but the more back pressure there will be, due
to the inability of the exhaust steam to get out easily.
So the exhaust nozzle should be as large as circumstances
<a id="Page_136" href="#Page_136" class="pagenum" title="136"> </a>
will permit. It is a favorite trick with engineers testing
the pulling power of their engines to remove the exhaust
nozzle entirely for a few minutes when the fire is up.
The back pressure saved will at once show in the pulling
power of the engine, and every one will be surprised. Of
course the fire couldn’t be kept going long without the
nozzle on. We have already pointed out that a natural
draft is better than a forced one. Here is another reason
for it.</p>


<h3>LEAKS.</h3>

<p>Leaks always cause a waste of power. They may usually
be seen when about the boiler; but leaks in the piston
and valve will often go unnoticed.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that if a valve does not travel a
short distance beyond the end of its seat, it will wear the
part it does travel on, while the remaining part will not
wear and will become a shoulder. Such a shoulder will
nearly always cause a leak in the valve, and besides will
add the friction, and otherwise destroy the economy of
the engine.</p>

<p>Likewise the piston will wear part of the cylinder and
leave a shoulder at either end if it does not pass entirely
beyond the steam-tight portion of the inside of the cylinder.
That it may always do this and yet leave sufficient
clearance, the counterbore has been devised. All good
engines are bored larger at each end so that the piston
will pass beyond the steam-tight portion a trifle at the
end of each stroke. Of course it must not pass far enough
to allow any steam to get through.</p>

<p>Self-setting piston rings are now generally used. They
are kept in place by their own tension. There will always
be a little leakage at the lap. The best lap is probably
a broken joint rather than a diagonal one. Moreover,
as the rings wear they will have a tendency to get
loose unless they are thickest at a point just opposite to
the lap, since this is the point at which it is necessary to
make up for the tension lost by the lapping.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENGINES.</span></h2>


<h3>STATIONARY.</h3>

<p>So far we have described and referred exclusively to
the usual form of the farm traction engine, which is
nearly always the simplest kind of an engine, except in
one particular, namely, the reverse which gives a variable
cut-off. Stationary engines, however, are worked under
such conditions that various changes in the arrangement
may be made which gives economy in operating, or other
desirable qualities. We will now briefly describe some
of the different kinds of stationary engines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_137">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="550" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>D. JUNE &amp; CO.’S STATIONARY FOUR-VALVE ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>THROTTLING AND AUTOMATIC CUT-OFF TYPES.</h3>

<p>Engines may be divided into two classes, namely, throttling
and automatic cut-off engines. The throttling
engine regulates the speed of the engine by cutting off
the supply of steam from the boiler, either by the hand
<a id="Page_138" href="#Page_138" class="pagenum" title="138"> </a>
of the engineer on the throttle or by a governor working
a special throttling governor valve. Railroad locomotives
are throttling engines, and moreover they have no governor,
the speed being regulated by the engineer at the
throttle valve. Traction engines are usually throttling
engines provided with a governor.</p>

<p>An automatic cut-off engine regulates its speed by a
governor connected with the valve, and does it by shortening
the time during which steam can enter the cylinder.
This is a great advantage, in that the expansive power
of steam is given a chance to work, while in the throttling
engine steam is merely cut off. The subject has been
fully discussed under “Economy in Running a Farm
Engine.” An automatic cut-off engine is much the most
economical.</p>

<p>While on traction engines the governor is usually of
the ball variety, on stationary engines improved forms
of governors are also placed in the fly wheel, and work
in various ways, according to the requirements of the
valve gear.</p>


<h3>THE CORLISS ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Corliss engine is a type now well known and made
by many different manufacturers. It is considered one
of the most economical stationary engines made, but
cannot be used for traction purposes. It may be compound,
and may be used with a condenser. It cannot
be used as a high speed engine, since the valves will not
work rapidly enough.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of a Corliss engine is the arrangement
of the valves. It has four valves instead of one, and
they are of the semi-rotary type. They consist of a
small, long cylinder which rocks back and forth, so as
to close and open the port, which is rather wide and
short compared to other types. There is a valve at each
end of the cylinder opening usually into the clearance
space, to admit steam; and two more valves below the
cylinder for the exhaust. These exhaust valves allow
any water of condensation to run out of the cylinder.
Moreover, as the steam when it leaves the cylinder is
<a id="Page_139" href="#Page_139" class="pagenum" title="139"> </a>
much colder than when it enters, the exhaust always
cools the steam ports, and when the same ports are used
for exhaust and admission the fresh steam has to pass
through ports that have been cooled and cause condensation.
In the Corliss engine the exhaust does not have
an opportunity to cool the live steam ports and the condensation
is reduced. This works considerable economy.</p>

<p>Also the Corliss valves have little friction from steam
pressure on their own backs, since the moment they are
lifted from their seats they work freely. The valves are
controlled by a governor so as to make the automatic
cut-off engine.</p>

<p>The Corliss type of frame for engine is often used on
traction engines and means the use of convex shoes on
cross-head and concave ways or guides. In locomotive
type, cross-head slides in four square angle guides.</p>


<h3>THE HIGH SPEED ENGINE.</h3>

<p>A high speed engine means one in which the speed of
the piston back and forth is high, rather than the speed
of rotation, there being sometimes a difference. High
speed engines came into use because of the need of such
to run dynamos for electric lighting. Without a high
speed engine an intermediate gear would have to be
used, so as to increase the speed of the operating shaft.
In the high speed engine this is done away with.</p>

<p>As an engine’s power varies directly as its speed as
well as its cylinder capacity or size, an engine commonly
used for ten horsepower would become a twenty horsepower
engine if the speed could be doubled. So high
speed engines are very small and compact, and require
less metal to build them. Therefore they should be much
cheaper per horsepower.</p>

<p>A high speed engine differs from a low speed in no
essential particular, except the adjustment of parts.
A high steam pressure must be used; a long, narrow
valve port is used, so that the full steam pressure may
be let on quickly at the beginning of the stroke when
the piston is reversing its motion and needs power to
get started quickly on its return; the slide valve must be
<a id="Page_140" href="#Page_140" class="pagenum" title="140"> </a>
used, since the semi-rotary Corliss would be too wide and
short for a quick opening. Some high speed engines are
built which use four valves, as does the Corliss. The
friction of the slide valve is usually “balanced” in some
way, either by “pressure plates” above the valve, which
prevent the steam from getting at the top and pressing
the valve down, or by letting the steam under the valve,
making it slide on narrow strips, since the pressure above
would then be reduced in proportion with the smallness
of the bearing surface below, and if the bearing surface
were very small the pressure above would be correspondingly
small, perhaps only enough to keep the valve in
place. Some automatic cut-off gear is almost always
used. A high speed engine may attain 900 revolutions
per minute, 600 being common. In many ways it is
economical.</p>


<h3>CONDENSING AND NON-CONDENSING.</h3>

<p>In the traction engine the exhaust is used in the smokestack
to help the draft, since the smokestack must necessarily
be short. A stationary engine is usually provided
with a boiler set in brickwork, and a furnace with a high
chimney, which creates all the draft needed. In other
words, the heated gases wasted in a traction engine are
utilized to make the draft.</p>

<p>It then becomes desirable to save the power in the exhaust
steam in some way. Some of this can be used to
heat the feed water, but only a fraction of it.</p>

<p>Now when the exhaust steam issues into the air it
must overcome the pressure of the atmosphere, nearly
15 lbs. to the square inch, which is a large item to begin
with. This can be saved by letting the steam exhaust
into a condenser, where a spray of cold water or the
like suddenly condenses the steam so that a vacuum is
created. There is then no back pressure on the exhaust
steam, theoretically. Practically a perfect vacuum cannot
be created, and there is a back pressure of 2 or 3
lbs. per square inch. By the use of a condenser a back
pressure of about 12 lbs. is taken off the head of the
piston on its return stroke, a matter of considerable
<a id="Page_141" href="#Page_141" class="pagenum" title="141"> </a>
economy. But an immense amount of water is required
to run a condenser, namely, 20 times as much for a given
saving of power as is required in a boiler to make that
power. So condensers are used only where water is
cheap.</p>


<h3>COMPOUND AND CROSS-COMPOUND.</h3>

<p>We have already explained the economy effected by the
compound engine, in which a large low pressure cylinder
<a id="Page_142" href="#Page_142" class="pagenum" title="142"> </a>
is operated by the exhaust from a small high pressure
cylinder. In the cut used for illustration the low pressure
cylinder is in direct line with the high pressure cylinder,
and one piston rod connects both pistons. This arrangement
is called the “tandem.” Sometimes the low pressure
cylinder is placed by the side of the high pressure, or at a
distance from it, and operates another piston and connecting
rod. By using a steam chest to store the exhaust
steam and varying the cut-off of the two cylinders,
the crank of the low pressure may be at an angle of
90 degrees with the crank of the high pressure, and there
can be no dead center.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_141">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="550" height="321" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE WOOLF COMPOUND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When a very high pressure of steam is used the exhaust
from the low pressure cylinder may be used to
operate a third cylinder; and the exhaust from that to
operate a fourth. Engines so arranged are termed triple
and quadruple expansion engines, or multiple expansion.</p>

<p>The practical saving of a compound engine when its
value can be utilized to the full is 10 per cent to 20 per
cent. Small engines are seldom compounded, large engines
nearly always.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII" href="#toc">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<span class="chapter-title">GAS AND GASOLINE ENGINES.</span></h2>


<p>The gas and gasoline engines (they are exactly the
same except that one generates the gas it needs from
gasoline, while the other takes common illuminating
gas, the use of gas or gasoline being interchangeable on
the same engine by readjustment of some of the parts)
are operated on a principle entirely different from steam.
While they are arranged very much as a steam engine,
the power is given by an explosion of gas mixed with
air in the cylinder. Instead of being a steady pressure
like that furnished by steam, it is a sudden pressure
given to one end of the piston usually once in four
strokes or two revolutions, one stroke being required
to draw the gasoline in, the second to compress it, the
third to receive the effect of the explosion (this is the
only power stroke), the fourth to push out the burned
gases preparatory to admitting a new charge. The fact
that force is given the cylinder at such wide intervals
makes it necessary to have an extra heavy flywheel to
keep the engine steady, and the double cylinder engine
which can give a stroke at least every revolution is still
better and is indispensable when the flywheel cannot
be above a certain weight.</p>

<p>For small horsepowers, such as are required for pumping,
feed grinding, churning, etc., the gas engine is so
much more convenient and so very much cheaper in
operation than the small steam engine that it is safe to
say that within a very few years the gas engine will
have completely displaced the small steam engine. In
fact, the discovery of the gas engine permits the same
economies for the small engine that the progress in
steam engineering has made possible for the large steam
engine. As yet the gas engine has made little or no
progress against the large steam plant, with its Corliss
<a id="Page_144" href="#Page_144" class="pagenum" title="144"> </a>
engine, its triple expansion, its condenser, and all the
other appliances which are not practicable with the small
engine.</p>


<h3>COMPARISON OF STEAM AND GAS ENGINES.</h3>

<p>The following points prepared by an experienced
farm engine manufacturer will show clearly the advantages
of the gas engine over the steam engine for general
use about a farm:</p>

<p>In the first place, the farmer uses power, as a rule,
at short intervals, and also uses small power. Should he
install a steam engine and wish power for an hour or
two, it would be necessary for him to start a fire under
the boiler and get up steam before he could start the
engine. This would take at least an hour. At the end
of the run he would have a good fire and good steam
pressure, but no use for it, and would have to let the
fire die out and the pressure run down. This involves
a great waste of water, time and fuel. With a gasoline
engine he is always ready and can start to work within
a few minutes after he makes up his mind to do so, and
he does not have to anticipate his wants in the power
line for half a day. Aside from this, in some states,
notably Ohio, the law compels any person operating
an engine above ten horsepower to carry a steam engineer’s
license. This does not apply to a gasoline engine.</p>

<p>Again, the gasoline engine is as portable as a traction
engine, and can be applied to all the uses of a traction
engine and to general farm use all the rest of the year.
At little expense it can be fitted up to hoist hay, to pump
water, to husk and shell corn, to saw wood, and even
by recent inventions to plowing. It is as good about a
farm as an extra man and a team of horses.</p>

<p>A gasoline engine can be run on a pint of gasoline
per hour for each horsepower, and as soon as the work
is done there is no more consumption of fuel and the
engine can be left without fear, except for draining off
the water in the water jacket in cold weather. A steam
engine for farm use would require at least four pounds
of coal per horsepower per hour, and in the majority of
cases it would be twice that, taking into consideration
<a id="Page_145" href="#Page_145" class="pagenum" title="145"> </a>
the amount of fuel necessary to start the fire and that
left unburned after the farmer is through with his power.
If you know the cost of crude gasoline at your point
and the cost of coal, you can easily figure the exact
economy of a gasoline engine for your use. To the
economy of fuel question may be added the labor or
cost of pumping or hauling water.</p>

<p>The only point wherein a farmer might find it advantageous
to have a steam plant would be where he is running
a dairy and wished steam and hot water for cleansing
his creamery machinery. This can be largely overcome
by using the water from the jackets which can be
kept at a temperature of about 175 degrees, and if a
higher temperature is needed he can heat it with the
exhaust from the engine. The time will certainly come
soon when no farmer will consider himself up to date
until he has a gasoline engine.</p>

<p>Some persons unaccustomed to gasoline may wonder
if a gasoline engine is as safe as a steam engine. The
fact is, they are very much safer, and do not require a
skilled engineer to run them. The gasoline tank is usually
placed outside the building, where the danger from
an explosion is reduced to a minimum. The only danger
that may be encountered is in starting the engine, filling
the supply tank when a burner near at hand is in flame,
etc. Once a gasoline engine is started and is supplied
with gasoline, it may be left entirely alone without care
for hours at a time without danger and without adjustment.</p>

<p>With a steam engine there is always danger, unless a
highly skilled man is watching the engine every moment.
If the water gets a little low he is liable to have an explosion;
if it gets a little too high he may knock out a
cylinder head in his engine; the fire must be fed every
few minutes; the grates cleaned. There is always something
to be done about a steam engine.</p>

<p>So here is another point of great saving in a gasoline
engine, namely, the saving of one man’s time. The
man who runs the gasoline engine may give nearly all
his time to other work, such as feeding a corn-sheller,
a fodder chopper, or the like.</p>
<a id="Page_146" href="#Page_146" class="pagenum" title="146"> </a>

<p>Kerosene may also be used in the same way with a
special type of gas engine.</p>

<p>The amounts of fuel required of the different kinds
possible in a gas engine are compared as follows by
Roper:</p>

<p>Illuminating gas, 17 to 20 cubic feet per horsepower
per hour.</p>

<p>Pittsburg natural gas, as low as 11 cubic feet.</p>

<p>74° gasoline, known as stove gasoline, one-tenth of a
gallon.</p>

<p>Refined petroleum, one-tenth of a gallon.</p>

<p>If a gas producing plant using coal supplies the gas,
one pound of coal per horsepower per hour is sufficient
on a large engine.</p>


<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE GAS OR GASOLINE ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The gas engine consists of a cylinder and piston, piston
rod, cross-head, connecting rod, crank and flywheel,
very similar to those used in the steam engine.</p>

<p>There is a gas valve, an exhaust valve, and in connection
with the gas valve a self-acting air valve. The
gas valve and the exhaust valve are operated by lever
arm or cam worked from the main shaft, arranged by
spiral gear or the like so that it gets one movement for
each two revolutions of the main shaft. Such an engine
is called “four cycle” (meaning one power stroke to each
four strokes of the piston), and works as follows:</p>

<p>As the piston moves forward the air and fuel valves
are simultaneously opened and closed, starting to open
just as the piston starts forward and closing just as the
piston completes its forward stroke. Gas and air are
simultaneously sucked into the cylinder, by this movement.
As the cylinder returns it compresses the charge
taken in during the forward stroke until it again reaches
back center. The mixture in the Otto engine is compressed
to about 70 pounds per square inch. Ignition
then takes place, causing the mixture to explode and
giving the force from which the power is derived. As
the crank again reaches its forward center the piston
uncovers a port which allows the greater part of the
burnt gases to escape.   As the piston comes back, the
<a id="Page_147" href="#Page_147" class="pagenum" title="147"> </a>
exhaust valve is opened, enabling the piston to sweep out
the remainder of the burnt gases. By the time the crank
is on the back center the exhaust valve is closed and
the engine is ready to take another charge, having completed
<a id="Page_148" href="#Page_148" class="pagenum" title="148"> </a>
two revolutions or four strokes. The side shaft
which performs the functions of opening and closing
the valves, getting its motion in the Columbus engine
by a pair of spiral gears, makes but one revolution to
two of the crank shaft.</p>

<a class="enlarge" href="images/i_147-large.jpg">[enlarge]</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gas engines are governed in various ways. One
method is to attach a ball governor similar to the Waters
on the steam engine. When the speed is too high, the
balls go out, and a valve is closed or partly closed, cutting
off the fuel supply. Since the engine takes in fuel
only once in four strokes, the governing cannot be so
close as on the steam engine, since longer time must
elapse before the governor can act.</p>

<p>Another type of governor operates by opening the
exhaust port and holding it open. The piston then
merely draws in air through the exhaust port, but no
gas. This is called the “hit or miss” governing type.
One power stroke is missed completely.</p>

<p>The heat caused by the explosion within the cylinder
is very great, some say as high as 3,000 degrees. Such
a heat would soon destroy the oil used to lubricate the
cylinder and make the piston cut, as well as destroying
the piston packing. To keep this heat down the cylinder
is provided with a water jacket, and a current of
water is kept circulating around it to cool it off.</p>

<p>When gas is used, the gas is passed through a rubber
bag, which helps to make the supply even. It is admitted
to the engine by a valve similar to the throttle
valve on an engine.</p>

<p>Gasoline is turned on by a similar valve, or throttle.
It does not have to be gasefied, but is sucked into the
cylinder in the form of a spray. As soon as the engine
is started, the high heat of the cylinder caused by the
constant explosions readily turns the gasoline to gas as
it enters. The supply tank of gasoline is placed outside
the building, or at a distance, and stands at a point below
the feed. A small pump pumps it up to a small
box or feed tank, which has an overflow pipe to conduct
any superfluous gasoline back to the supply tank. In
the gasoline box or feed tank a conical-shaped basin is
filled with gasoline to a certain height, which can be
<a id="Page_149" href="#Page_149" class="pagenum" title="149"> </a>
regulated. Whatever this conical basin contains is sucked
into the cylinder with the air. By regulating the amount
in the basin the supply of gasoline in the cylinder can
be regulated to the amount required for any given
amount of work. In the Columbus engine this regulation
is accomplished by screwing the overflow regulator
up or down.</p>

<p>There are two methods of igniting the charge in the
cylinder in order to explode it. One is by what is called
a gasoline or gas torch. A hollow pin or pipe is fixed in
the top of the cylinder. The upper part of this pin or
pipe runs up into a gasoline or gas lamp of the Bunsen
type where it is heated red hot. When the gas and air
in the cylinder are compressed by the back stroke of the
piston, some of the mixture is forced up into this pipe
or tube until it comes in contact with the heated portion
and is exploded, together with the rest of the charge in
the cylinder. Of course this tube becomes filled with
burnt gases which must be compressed before the explosive
mixture can reach the heated portion, and no explosion
is theoretically possible until the piston causes
compression to the full capacity of the cylinder. The
length of the tube must therefore be nicely regulated
to the requirements of the particular engine used.</p>

<p>The other method is by an electric spark from a battery.
Two electrodes of platinum or some similar substance
are placed in the compression end of the cylinder.
The spark might be caused by bringing the electrodes
sufficiently near together at just the right moment,
but the more practical and usual way is to break
the current, closing it sharply by means of a lever
worked by the gearing at just the moment the piston
is ready to return after compressing the charge. The
electric spark is by long odds the most desirable method
of ignition, being safer and easier to take care of, but
it requires some knowledge of electricity and electric
connection to keep it always in working order.</p>


<h3>OPERATION OF GAS AND GASOLINE ENGINES.</h3>

<p>To all intents and purposes the operation of a gas or
gasoline engine is the same as that of a steam engine
<a id="Page_150" href="#Page_150" class="pagenum" title="150"> </a>
with the care of the boiler eliminated. The care of the
engine itself is practically the same, though the bearings
are relatively larger in a gasoline or gas engine and
do not require adjustment so often. Some manufacturers
will tell you that a gas engine requires no attention at
all. Any one who went on that theory would soon ruin
his engine. To keep a gasoline engine in working order
so as to get the best service from it and make it last as
long as possible, you should give it the best of care.</p>

<p>An engine of this kind needs just as much oiling and
cleaning as a steam engine. All bearings must be lubricated
and kept free from dirt, great care must be taken
that the piston and cylinder are well lubricated. In addition,
the engineer must see that the valves all work
perfectly tight, and when they leak in any way they
must be taken out and cleaned. Usually the valve seats
are cast separate from the cylinder, so that they can be
removed and ground when they have worn.</p>

<p>Also the water jacket must be kept in order so that the
cylinder cannot become too hot.</p>


<h3>STARTING A GASOLINE ENGINE.</h3>

<p>It is something of a trick to get a gasoline or gas
engine started—especially a gasoline engine—and some
skill must be developed in this or there will be trouble.
This arises from the fact that when an engine has not
been running the cylinder is cold and does not readily
gasefy the gasoline. At best only a part of a charge of
gasoline can be gasefied, and if the cylinder is very cold
indeed the charge will not explode at all till the cylinder
is warmed up.</p>

<p>When preparing to start an engine, first see that the
nuts or studs holding cylinder head to cylinder are tight,
as the heating and cooling of the cylinder are liable to
loosen them. Then oil all bearings with a hand oil can,
and carefully wipe off all outside grease.</p>

<p>When all is ready, work the gasoline pump to get the
air out of the feed pipes and fill the reservoir.</p>

<p>First, the engine must be turned so that the piston is
as far back as it will go, and to prevent air being pressed
<a id="Page_151" href="#Page_151" class="pagenum" title="151"> </a>
back the exhaust must be held open, or a cock in priming
cup on top of cylinder opened.</p>

<p>If gasoline priming is needed, the gasoline must be
poured into the priming cup after closing the cock into the
cylinder, for it would do no good to merely let the gasoline
run down into the cylinder in a cold stream: it must
be sprayed in. If the exhaust has been held open, and the
priming charge of gasoline is to be drawn in through the
regular supply pipe and valve, the exhaust should be
closed and the throttle turned on to a point indicated
by the manufacturer of the engine.</p>

<p>We suppose that the igniter is ready to work. If the
hot tube is used, the tube should be hot; if the electric
igniter is used, the igniter bar should be in position to
be snapped so as to close the circuit and cause a spark
when the charge has been compressed.</p>

<p>If all is ready, open the cock from which the supply
of gasoline is to be obtained, and at the same time turn
the engine over so as to draw the charge into the cylinder.
If a priming cock has been opened, that must be
closed by hand as soon as the cylinder is filled and the
piston ready to return for compression. If the regular
feed is used, the automatic valve will close of itself.</p>

<p>Bring the flywheel over to back center so that piston
will compress the charge. With the flywheel in the hand,
bring the piston back sharply two or three times, compressing
the charge. This repeated compression causes
a little heat to be liberated, which warms up the cylinder
inside. If the cylinder is very cold this compression
may be repeated until the cylinder is sufficiently warm
to ignite. When performing this preparatory compression
the piston may be brought nearly up to the dead center
but not quite. At last bring it over the dead center, and
just as it passes over, snap the electric ignition bar. If
an explosion follows the engine will be started.</p>

<p>If the hot tube is used, the flywheel may be brought
around sharply each time so that the piston will pass the
dead center, as an explosion will follow complete compression.
If the explosion does not follow, the flywheel
may be turned back again and brought up sharply past
<a id="Page_152" href="#Page_152" class="pagenum" title="152"> </a>
the dead center. Each successive compression will warm
up the cylinder a little till at last an explosion will take
place and the engine will be started.</p>

<p>More gasoline will be needed to start in cold weather
than in warm, and the starting supply should be regulated
accordingly. Moreover, when the engine gets to going,
the cylinder will warm up, more of the gasoline will vaporize,
and a smaller supply will be needed. Then the
throttle can be turned so as to reduce the supply.</p>

<p>After the engine is started, the water jacket should be
set in operation, and you should see that the cylinder
lubrication is taking place as it ought.</p>

<p>As the above method of starting the engine will not always
work well, especially in cold weather, what are
called “self-starters” are used. They are variously arranged
on different engines, but are constructed on the
same general principle. This is, first, to pump air and
gasoline into the cylinder instead of drawing it in by suction.
Sometimes the gasoline is forced in by an air compression
tank. The engine is turned just past the back
center, care having been taken to make sure that the
stroke is the regular explosion stroke. This may be told
by looking at the valve cam or shaft. If an electric igniter
is used, it is set ready to snap by hand. If the tube
igniter is used, a detonator is arranged in the cylinder, to
be charged by the head of a snapping parlor match which
can be exploded by hand. Holding the flywheel with one
hand with piston just past back center, fill the compressed
end of the cylinder by working the pump or turning on
the air in compression tank till you feel a strong pressure
on the piston through the flywheel. Then snap igniter
or detonator and the engine is off. If throttle valve has
not been opened, it may now be immediately opened.</p>

<p>The skill comes in managing the flywheel with one
hand, or one hand and a foot, and the igniter, etc., with
the other hand. Care must be exercised not to get caught
when the flywheel starts off. The foot must never be put
through the arm of the wheel, the wheel merely being
held when necessary by the ball of the big toe, so that if
the flywheel should start suddenly it would merely slip
<a id="Page_153" href="#Page_153" class="pagenum" title="153"> </a>
off the toe without carrying the foot around or unbalancing
the engineer. Until one gets used to it, it is better to
have some one else manage the flywheel, while you look
after the gasoline supply, igniter, etc. When used to it,
one man can easily start any gasoline engine up to 15
horsepower.</p>


<h3>WHAT TO DO WITH A GASOLINE ENGINE WHEN IT DOESN’T
WORK.</h3>

<h4>Questions and Answers.</h4>

<p>Q. If the engine suddenly stops, what would you do?</p>

<p>A. First, see that the gasoline feed is all right, plenty
of gasoline in the tank, feed pipe filled, gasoline pump
working, and then if valves are all in working order.
Perhaps there may be dirt in the feed reservoir, or the pipe
leading from it may be stopped up. If everything is
right so far, examine the valves to see that they work
freely and do not get stuck from lack of good oil, or
from use of poor oil. Raise them a few times to see if
they work freely. Carefully observe if the air valve is
not tight in sleeve of gas valve.</p>

<p>Q. What would be the cause of the piston’s sticking
in the cylinder?</p>

<p>A. Either it was not properly lubricated, or it got too
hot, the heat causing it to expand.</p>

<p>Q. Are boxes on a gasoline engine likely to get hot?</p>

<p>A. Yes, though not so likely as on a steam engine.
They must be watched with the same care as they would
be on a steam engine. If the engine stops, turn it by
hand a few times to see that it works freely without
sticking anywhere.</p>

<p>Q. Is the electric sparking device likely to get out of
order?</p>

<p>A. Yes. You can always test it by loosening one
wire at the cylinder and touching it to the other to see
that a spark passes between them. If there is no spark,
there is trouble with the battery.</p>

<p>Q. How should the batteries be connected up?</p>

<p>A. A wire should pass from carbon of No. 1 to copper
<a id="Page_154" href="#Page_154" class="pagenum" title="154"> </a>
of No. 2; from carbon of No. 2 to copper of No. 3,
etc., always from copper to carbon, never from carbon
to carbon or copper to copper. Wire from last carbon
to spark coil and from coil to switch, and from switch
to one of the connections on the engine. Wire from
copper of No. 1 to the other connection on the engine.
In wiring, always scrape the ends of the wire clean and
bright where the connection is to be made with any other
metal.</p>

<p>Q. What precautions can be taken to keep batteries
in order?</p>

<p>A. The connections between the cells can be changed
every few days, No. 1 being connected with No. 3, No.
3 with No. 5, etc., alternating them, but always making
a single line of connection from one connection on cylinder
to first copper, from the carbon of that cell to copper
of next cell, and so on till the circuit to the cylinder is
completed. When the engine is not in operation, always
throw out the switch, to prevent possible short circuiting.
If battery is feeble at first, fasten wires together for half
an hour at engine till current gets well started.</p>

<p>Q. Is there likely to be trouble with the igniter inside
cylinder?</p>

<p>A. There may be. You will probably find a plug that
can be taken out so as to provide a peep hole. Never put
your eye near this hole, for some gasoline may escape
and when spark is made it will explode and put out your
eye. Always keep the eye a foot away from the hole.
Practice looking at the spark when you know it is all
right and no gasoline is near, in order that you may get
the right position at which to see the spark in case of
trouble. In any case, always take pains to force out any
possible gas before snapping igniter to see if the spark
works all right.</p>

<p>Q. If there is no spark, what should be done?</p>

<p>A. Clean the platinum points. This may be done
by throwing out switch and cutting a piece of pine one-eighth
of an inch thick and one-half inch wide, and rubbing
it between the points. It may be necessary to push
cam out a trifle to compensate for wear.</p>
<a id="Page_155" href="#Page_155" class="pagenum" title="155"> </a>

<p>Q. How can you look into peep hole without endangering
eyesight?</p>

<p>A. By use of a mirror.</p>

<p>Q. If the hot tube fails to work, what may be done?</p>

<p>A. Conditions of atmosphere, pressure, etc., vary so
much that the length of the tube cannot always be determined.
If a tube of the usual length fails to work,
try one a little longer or shorter, but not varying over
1½ inches.</p>

<p>Q. When gas is used, what may interfere with gas
supply?</p>

<p>A. Water in the gas pipes. This is always true of
gas pipes not properly drained, especially in cold weather
when condensation may take place. If water accumulates,
tubes must be taken apart and blown out, and if
necessary a drain cock can be put in at the lowest point.</p>

<p>Q. What trouble is likely to be had with the valves?</p>

<p>A. In time the seats will wear, and must be taken
out and ground with flour or emery.</p>

<p>Q. Should the cylinder of a gasoline engine be kept
as cool as it can be kept with running water?</p>

<p>A. No. It should be as hot as the hand can be borne
upon it, or about 100 degrees. If it is kept cooler than
this the gasoline will not gasefy well. If a tank is used,
the circulation in the tank will justify the temperature
properly. The water may be kept at 175 degrees of
temperature, and used for hot water heating. The exhaust
gases are also hot and may be used for heating
by carrying in pipes coiled in a hot water heater.</p>

<p>Q. Are water joints likely to leak?</p>

<p>A. Yes. The great heating given the cylinder is liable
to loosen the water joints. They are best packed with
asbestos soaked in oil, sheets 1-16 inch thick. Old packing
should always be thoroughly cleaned off when new
packing is put in.</p>

<p>Q. How may the bearings be readjusted when worn?</p>

<p>A. Usually there are liners to adjust bearing. In
crank box adjust as in steam engine by tightening the
key.</p>
<a id="Page_156" href="#Page_156" class="pagenum" title="156"> </a>

<p>Q. If you hear a loud explosion in the exhaust pipe
after the regular explosion, should you be alarmed?</p>

<p>A. No. All gas or gasoline engines give them at
times and they are harmless. If the gas or gasoline fed
to the engine is not sufficient to make an explosive mixture,
the engine will perhaps miss the explosion, and
live gas will go into the exhaust pipe. After two or three
of these have accumulated an explosion may take place
and the burned gases coming out of the port as hot
flames will explode the live gas previously exhausted.
Any missing of the regular explosion by the engine,
through trouble with battery, or the like, will cause the
same condition.</p>

<p>Q. When you get exhaust pipe explosions, what
should you do?</p>

<p>A. Turn on the fuel till the exhaust is smoky. Then
you know you have fuel enough and more than enough.
If the explosions still continue, conclude that the igniter
spark is too weak, or does not take place.</p>

<p>Q. What precaution must be taken in cold weather?</p>

<p>A. The water must be carefully drained out of jacket.</p>

<p>Q. Will common steam engine cylinder oil do for a
gasoline engine?</p>

<p>A. No. The heat is so great that only a special high
grade mineral oil will do. Any oil containing animal
fat will be worse than useless.</p>

<p>Q. How can you tell if right amount of gas or gasoline
is being fed to engine to give highest power?</p>

<p>A. Turn on as much as possible without producing
smoke. A smokeless mixture is better than one which
causes smoke.</p>

<p>Q. If you have reason to suppose gas may be in the
cylinder, should you try to start cylinder?</p>

<p>A. No. Empty the gas all out by turning the engine
over a few times by hand, holding exhaust open if necessary.</p>

<p>Q. How long will a battery run without recharging?</p>

<p>A. The time varies. Usually not over three or four
months.</p>
<a id="Page_157" href="#Page_157" class="pagenum" title="157"> </a>

<p>Q. Is it objectionable to connect an electric bell with
an engine battery?</p>

<p>A. Certainly. Never do it.</p>

<p>Q. If your engine doesn’t run, how many things are
likely to be the trouble?</p>

<p>A. Not more than four—compression, spark, gas
supply, valves.</p>

<span class="chapter-title">HOW TO RUN A THRESHING MACHINE.</span></h2>


<p>A threshing machine, though large, is a comparatively
simple machine, consisting of a cylinder with teeth working
into other teeth which are usually concaved (this
primary part really separates the grain from the husk),
and rotary fan and sieves to separate grain from chaff,
and some sort of stacker to carry off the straw. The
common stacker merely carries off the straw by some
endless arrangement of slats working in a long box;
while the so-called “wind stacker” is a pneumatic device
for blowing the straw through a large pipe. It has
the advantage of keeping the straw under more perfect
control than the common stacker. The separation of the
grain from the straw is variously effected by different
manufacturers, there being three general types, called
apron, vibrating, and agitating.</p>

<p>The following list of parts packed inside the J.&nbsp;I.
Case separator (of the agitative type) when it is shipped
will be useful for reference in connection with any type
of separator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 Hopper arms, Right and Left,</li>
  <li>1 Hopper bottom,</li>
  <li>1 Hopper rod with thumb nut,</li>
  <li>2 Feed tables,</li>
  <li>2 Feed table legs,</li>
  <li>2 Band cutter stands and bolts,</li>
  <li>1 Large crank shaft,</li>
  <li>1 Grain auger with 1223 T. pulley and 1154 T., Box,</li>
  <li>1 Tailings auger,</li>
  <li>1 Elevator spout,</li>
  <li>1 Elevator shake arm, complete,</li>
  <li>1 Set fish-backs, for straw-rack,</li>
  <li>1 Elevator pulley, 529 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Beater pulley, 6-inch 1254 T., or 4-inch 1255 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Elevator drive pulley 1673 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Crank pulley to drive grain auger 1605 T.,</li>
  <li><a id="Page_159" href="#Page_159" class="pagenum" title="159"> </a>1 Cylinder pulley to drive crank 4-inch 973 T., or 6-inch 1085 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Cylinder pulley to drive fan 1347 T., 1348 T., or 1633 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Fan pulley, 1244 T., or 1231 T.,</li>
  <li>1 Belt tightener, complete, with pulley,</li>
  <li>1 Belt reel, 5016 T., or 1642 T., with crank and bolt,</li>
  <li>4 Shoe sieves,</li>
  <li>4 Shoe rods, with nuts and washers,</li>
  <li>1 Conveyor extension,</li>
  <li>1 Sheet iron tail board,</li>
  <li>2 Tail board castings 1654 T., and 1655 T.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these are the parts of the stacker.</p>

<p>As each manufacturer furnishes all needed directions
for putting the parts together, we will suppose the separator
is in working condition.</p>

<p>A new machine should be set up and run for a couple
of hours before attempting to thresh any grain. The
oil boxes should be carefully cleaned, and all dirt, cinders,
and paint removed from the oil holes. The grease
cups on cylinder, beater and crank boxes should be
screwed down after being filled with hard oil, moderately
thin oil being used for other parts of the machine.
Before putting on the belts, turn the machine by hand
a few times to see that no parts are loose. Look into
the machine on straw rack and conveyor.</p>

<p>First connect up belt with engine and run the cylinder
only for a time. Screw down the grease cup lugs when
necessary, and see that no boxes heat. Take off the
tightener pulley, clean out oil chambers and thoroughly
oil the spindle. Then oil each separate bearing in turn,
seeing that oil hole is clean, and that pulley or journal
works freely. The successive belts may then be put on
one at a time, until the stacker belt is put on after its
pulleys have been oiled. Especially note which belts are
to run crossed—usually the main belt and the stacker belt.
You can tell by noting which way the machinery must
run to keep the straw moving in the proper direction.</p>

<p>Oiling on the first run of a machine is especially important,
as the bearings are a trifle rough and more liable
to heat than after machine has been used for some time.
<a id="Page_160" href="#Page_160" class="pagenum" title="160"> </a>
It is well to oil a
shaft while it runs,
since the motion
helps the oil to work
in over the whole surface.</p>

<p>The sieves, concaves,
check board
and blinds must be
adjusted to the kind
of grain to be
threshed. When they
have been so adjusted
the machine is
ready to thresh.</p>


<h3>SETTING SEPARATOR.</h3>

<p>It is important
that the machine be
kept perfectly steady,
and that it be level
from side to side,
though its being a
little higher or lower
at one end or the
other may not matter
much. If the level
sidewise is not perfect
the grain will
have a tendency to
work over to one
side. A spirit level
should be used.</p>

<a class="enlarge" href="images/i_160-large.jpg">[enlarge]</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>One or more of
the wheels should be
set in holes, according
to the unevenness of
the ground, and
the rear wheels
should be well blocked.
Get the holes
<a id="Page_161" href="#Page_161" class="pagenum" title="161"> </a>
ready, judging as well as possible what will give a true
level and a convenient position. Haul the machine into
position and see that it is all right before uncoupling the
engine. If holes need redigging to secure proper level,
machine may be pulled out and backed in again by the
engine. When machine is high in front it can easily be
leveled when engine or team have been removed, by
cramping the front wheels and digging in front of one
and behind the other, then pulling the tongue around
square.</p>

<p>Block the right hind wheel to prevent the belt drawing
machine forward. Always carry a suitable block to
have one handy.</p>

<p>In starting out of holes or on soft ground, cramp the
front axle around, and it will require only half the power
to start that would be required by a straight pull.</p>

<p>In setting the machine, if the position can be chosen,
choose one in which the straw will move in the general
direction of the wind, but a little quartering, so that dust
and smoke from engine will be carried away from the
men and the straw stack. In this position there is less
danger from fire when wood is used.</p>


<h3>THE CYLINDER.</h3>

<p>The cylinder is arranged with several rows of teeth
working into stationary teeth in what is called the concave.
It is important that all these teeth be kept tight,
and that the cylinder should not work from side to side.
The teeth are liable to get loose in a new machine, and
should be tightened up frequently. A little brine on each
nut will cause it to rust slightly and help to hold it in
place. If the cylinder slips endwise even a sixteenth of
an inch, the teeth will be so much nearer the concaves
on one side and so much farther away from them on the
other side. Where they are close, they will crack the
grain; where they are wide apart they will let the straw
go through without threshing or taking out the grain.
So it is important that the cylinder and its teeth run
true and steady. If the teeth get bent in any way, they
must be straightened.</p>
<a id="Page_162" href="#Page_162" class="pagenum" title="162"> </a>

<p>The speed of the cylinder is important, since its pulley
gives motion to the other parts of the machine, and
this movement must be up to a certain point to do the
work well. A usual speed for the cylinder pulley is
1,075 revolutions per minute, up to 1,150.</p>

<p>There is always an arrangement for adjusting the cylinder
endwise, so that teeth will come in the middle. This
should be adjusted carefully when necessary. The end
play to avoid heating may be about 1-64 of an inch. It
may be remembered that the cylinder teeth carry the straw
to the concaves, and the concaves do the threshing.</p>


<h3>THE CONCAVES.</h3>

<p>The concaves are to be adjusted to suit the kind of
grain threshed. When desiring to adjust concaves, lift
them up a few times and drop so as to jar out dust.
Wedging a block of wood between cylinder teeth and
concaves will in some types of separator serve to bring
up concaves when cylinder is slowly turned by hand.</p>

<p>There are from two to six rows of teeth in the concave,
and usually the number of rows is adjustable or
variable. Two rows will thresh oats, where six are required
for flax and timothy. Four rows are commonly
used for wheat and barley. The arrangement of rows
of teeth and blanks is important. When four rows are
used, one is commonly placed well back, one front, blank
in the middle. When straw is dry and brittle, cylinder
can be given “draw” by placing blank in front. Always
use as few teeth and leave them as low as possible to
thresh clean, since with more teeth than necessary set
higher than required the straw will be cut up and a great
deal of chopped straw will get into the sieves, all of which
also requires additional power. Sometimes the teeth can
be taken out of one row, so that one, three, or five rows
may be used. For especially difficult grain like Turkey
wheat, a concave with corrugated teeth may be used, in
sets of three rows each up to nine rows. The corrugated
teeth are used for alfalfa in localities where much is
raised.</p>
<a id="Page_163" href="#Page_163" class="pagenum" title="163"> </a>


<h3>THE BEATER AND CHECK BOARD.</h3>

<p>After the cylinder has loosened the grain from the
husk and straw, it must still be separated. Some threshers
have a grate under the cylinder and behind it. In
any case the beater causes the heavy grain to work
toward the bottom, and the check board keeps the grain
from being carried to rear on top of the straw, where
it would not have a chance to become separated. If the
grain is very heavy or damp, there may be a tendency
for the straw to stick to the cylinder and be carried
around too far. In such a case the beater should be
adjusted to give more space, and the check board raised
to allow the straw to pass to the rear freely.</p>


<h3>STRAW RACK.</h3>

<p>The straw rack and conveyor carry the straw and
grain to the rear with a vibratory movement, causing
the grain to be shaken out. To do good work the straw
rack must move with a sufficient number of vibrations
per minute, say 230. A speed indicator on the crank
shaft will show the number of vibrations best. Great
care must be taken with this part of the thresher, or a
great deal of grain will be carried into the straw. The
less the straw is cut up, the better this portion of the
machine works; so the smallest practicable number of
teeth in the concave should be used.</p>

<p>The crank boxes and pitmans should be adjusted so
that there is no pounding. If the rear vibrating arms
drop too low they get below the dead center and are
liable to break, at any rate causing severe pounding and
hard running. To prevent this, the crank boxes can be
moved forward by putting leather between them and
the posts, or should be otherwise adjusted. The trouble
being due to the pitmans having worn short, the pitmans
may be lengthened in some way by putting pieces
of leather over the end or the like, or new pitmans may
be introduced.</p>


<h3>THE FAN.</h3>

<p>The chief difficulty likely to arise with the fan is
blowing over grain. To prevent this blinds are usually
<a id="Page_164" href="#Page_164" class="pagenum" title="164"> </a>
arranged, which may be adjusted while the machine is
running so as to prevent the grain from being blown
over. At the same time it is important to clean the
grain, so the adjustment should not go to one extreme
or the other.</p>

<p>In windy weather the blinds should be closed more
on one side than on the other. The speed of the fan
must be adjusted to the requirements of the locality.</p>

<p>As much blast should be used as the grain will stand,
and heavy feeding requires more wind than light feeding,
since the chaff checks the blast to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the wind board over the
grain auger does not get bent, and it should be adjusted
so that the strongest part of the blast will come about
the middle of the sieve.</p>


<h3>SIEVES.</h3>

<p>There is usually one conveyor sieve, which causes the
grain to move along, and shoe sieves, which are required
to clean the grain thoroughly. Different kinds of sieves
are provided for different kinds of grain, and the proper
selection and adjustment of these sieves as to mesh, etc.,
is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Much depends on the way the sieves are set, and on
the rate at which the thresher is fed, or the amount of
work it is really doing. The best guide is close observation
and experience, both your own and that of other
threshermen.</p>


<h3>CONVEYOR EXTENSION.</h3>

<p>This carries the coarse chaff from the conveyor sieve
to the stacker. The conveyor sieve should be coarse
enough to let all the good grain through, as whatever
is carried on to the extension must be returned with the
tailings to the cylinder. This means so much waste
work. The conveyor extension is removable, and should
always be tight before machine is started. See that it is.</p>

<p>When necessary, the grain may be run over a screen,
which differs from a sieve in that the mesh is small and
intended to let dust and small chaff through while the
grain does not pass. The refuse from the screen is
<a id="Page_165" href="#Page_165" class="pagenum" title="165"> </a>
dropped onto the ground. All screens have a tendency
to become clogged, and in this condition obstruct the
grain and wind. It is desirable not to use them except
when necessary, and if used they should be frequently
cleaned.</p>


<h3>TAILINGS ELEVATOR.</h3>

<p>The tailings are carried back to the cylinder by an
elevator usually worked with a chain. This chain should
be kept tight enough not to unhook, yet not so tight as
to bind.</p>

<p>To put the chain into the elevator, tie a weight on a
rope and drop it down the lower part of the elevator.
The chain may be fastened to the rope and a man at
the top can then pull the chain up, while another feeds
it in at the bottom. When chain has been drawn up to
the top, the rope should be dropped down upper portion
of elevator and used at bottom to pull chain down after
it has been adjusted over the sprocket. Some one at the
bottom should continue to feed the chain in as it is
pulled down, so that it will go into the elevator straight.
When the chain has been pulled through it may be
hooked and adjusted to lower sprocket, and tightened
up by screws at top. Turn the chain around once by
hand to make sure there are no kinks in it.</p>

<p>The tailings should be small, containing no light chaff
and little full-size grain. They are a good indication of
how the sieves are working. If much good grain is
coming through, see if it gets over the conveyor sieve
by way of the extension to the tailings auger, or over
the shoe sieve. If the sieves are not right, they may be
adjusted in various ways, according to the directions of
the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Grain returned in the tailings is liable to get cracked
in the cylinder, and much chaff in the tailings chokes
the cylinder. For every reason, the tailings should be
kept as low as possible.</p>


<h3>SELF-FEEDER.</h3>

<p>The self-feeder is arranged to cut the bands of the
sheaves and feed the grain to the cylinder automatically.
<a id="Page_166" href="#Page_166" class="pagenum" title="166"> </a>
It has a governor to prevent crowding in too much
grain, and usually a change of pulleys for slow or fast
feeding, as circumstances may require. In starting a
new governor the friction pulley and inside of the band
should have paint scraped off, and a little oil should be
put on face of friction wheel. The carrier should not
start till the machine attains full threshing motion, and
to prevent this a few sheaves should be laid upon it. The
knife arms should be raised or lowered to adjust them to
the size of the sheaves and condition of the grain for
cutting bands.</p>

<p>The cranks and carrier shaft boxes should be oiled
regularly, but the friction bands should not be oiled after
it once becomes smooth.</p>


<h3>THE WIND STACKER.</h3>

<p>The wind stacker is arranged to swing by a hand-wheel
or the like, and also automatically.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken not to use the hand moving
apparatus when the stacker is set for automatic moving,
as a break is liable to follow. There is a clutch to stop
the stacker, however. At times it will be more convenient
to leave off the belt that causes the automatic
movement.</p>

<p>By the use of various pulleys the speed of the stacker
may be altered, and it should be run no faster than is
necessary to do the work required, which will depend on
the character of the straw. Any extra speed used will
add to the cost of running the engine and is a loss in
economy.</p>

<p>In moving machine with wind stacker in place, care
should be taken to see that it rests in its support before
machine moves.</p>

<p>The canvas curtain under the decking, used to turn
the straw into the hopper, may need a piece of wood
fastened to its lower edge to keep it more stiff when stiff
rye straw is passing. The bearings of the fan and jack
shafts should be kept well lubricated with hard oil, and
the bevel gears should be kept well greased with axle
grease applied with a stick. Other bearings and worm
gear of automatic device should be oiled with soft oil.</p>
<a id="Page_167" href="#Page_167" class="pagenum" title="167"> </a>

<p>The attached stacker is simple in operation, and if it
is desired not to use the automatic swinging device but
swing by hand, the automatic gear may be thrown out.
An independent stacker is managed in much the same
way.</p>


<h3>ATTACHMENTS.</h3>

<p>A weigher, bagger, and a high loader are usually used
with a separator. Their operation is simple, and depends
upon the particular type or make.</p>


<h3>BELTING.</h3>

<p>The care of the belting is one of the most important
things about the management of a threshing machine,
and success or failure will depend largely on the condition
in which the belts are kept. Of course the hair
side should be run next the band wheel. Once there was
disagreement among engineers on this point, but it has
been conclusively proven that belts wear longer this way
and get better friction, for the simple reason that the
flesh side is more flexible than the hair side, and when on
the outside better accommodates itself to the shape of
the pulley. If the hair side is outermost, it will be
stretched more or less in going around the pulley and in
time will crack. Rubber belts must be run with the seam
on the outside.</p>

<p>When leather belts become hard they should be softened
with neatsfoot oil. A flexible belt is said to transmit
considerably more power than a hard one.</p>

<p>Pulleys must be kept in line or the belt will slip off.
When pulleys are in line the belt has a tendency to work
to the tightest point. Hence pulleys are usually made
larger in the middle, which is called “crowning.”</p>

<p>Belts on a separator should be looked over every day,
and when any lacing is worn, it should be renewed at
once. This will prevent breaks during working, with
loss of time. Some threshermen carry an extra set of
belts to be ready in case anything does break, and they
assert that they save money by so doing.</p>

<p>Lacing is not stronger in proportion as it is heavy. If
it is heavy and clumsy it gets strained in going round
<a id="Page_168" href="#Page_168" class="pagenum" title="168"> </a>
the pulley, and soon gives out. The ideal way to lace
a belt is to make it as nearly like the rest of the belt as
possible, so that it will go over the pulleys without a
jar. The ends of the belt should be cut off square with
a try square, and a small punch used for making holes.
Holes should be equally spaced, and outside ones not so
near the edge as to tear out. The rule is a hole to every
inch of the belt, and in a leather belt they may be as
close as a quarter of an inch to the ends without tearing
out. Other things being equal, the nearer the ends the
holes are the better, as belt will then pass over pulley
more easily. The chief danger of tearing is between
the holes.</p>

<p>A stacker web belt may be laced by turning the ends
up and lacing them together flat at right angles to rest
of belt. Rubber or cotton belting that does not run over
idler or tightener pulleys so that both sides must be
smooth may be laced in this way. This lacing lasts two
or three times as long with such belts as any other, for
the reason that the string is not exposed to wear and
there is no straining in passing round pulleys.</p>

<p>The ordinary method of lacing a leather belt is to
make the laces straight on the pulley side, all running
in the same direction as the movement of the belt, and
crossing them on the outside diagonally in both directions.
When belts run on pulleys on both sides, as they
do on the belt driving beater and crank, and also on
wind stacker, a hinge lacing may be made by crossing
the lacing around the end of the belt to the next adjacent
hole opposite, the lacing showing the same on both
sides. This allows the belt to bend equally well either
way.</p>

<p>The best way to fasten a lacing is to punch a hole
where the next row of lace holes would come when the
belt is cut off, and after passing the lace through this
hole, bring the end around and force it through again,
cutting the end off short after it has passed through.
This hole must be small enough to hold the lace securely,
and care should be taken that it is in position to be used
as a lace-hole the next time a series of holes is required.</p>

<p>New belts stretch a good deal, and the ends of the
<a id="Page_169" href="#Page_169" class="pagenum" title="169"> </a>
lacing should not be cut off short till the stretch is taken
out of the belts.</p>

<p>Belting that has got wet will shrink and lacing must
be let out before belt is put on again. Tight belts have
been known to break the end of a shaft off, and always
cause unnecessary friction.</p>

<p>Cotton or Gandy belting should not be punched for
lacing, but holes made with a pointed awl, since punching
cuts some of the threads and weakens belt.</p>


<h3>HOW TO BECOME A GOOD FEEDER.</h3>

<p>The art of becoming a good feeder will not be learned
in a day. The bundles should be tipped well up against
the cylinder cap, and flat bundles turned on edge, so that
cylinder will take them from the top. It is not hard to
spread a bundle, and in fast threshing a bundle may be
fed on each side, each bundle being kept pretty well to
its own side, while the cylinder is kept full the entire
width. A good feeder will keep the straw carrier evenly
covered with straw, and will watch the stacker, tailings
and grain elevator and know the moment anything goes
wrong.</p>


<h3>WASTE.</h3>

<p>No threshing machine will save every kernel of the
grain, but the best results can be attained only by care
and judgment in operating.</p>

<p>It is easy to exaggerate the loss of grain, for if a
very small stream of grain is seen going into the straw
it will seem enormous, though it will not amount to a
bushel a day. There are practically a million kernels of
wheat in a bushel, or 600 handfuls, and even if a handful
is wasted every minute, it would not be enough to counterbalance
the saving in finishing a job quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, waste must be watched, however, and
checked if too great. First determine whether the grain
is carried over in the straw or the waste is at the shoe
sieve.</p>

<p>If the waste is in the conveyor sieve, catch a handful
of the chaff, and if grain is found, see whether the sieve
is the proper mesh. Too high a speed will cause the
<a id="Page_170" href="#Page_170" class="pagenum" title="170"> </a>
grain to be carried over. If too many teeth are used in
the concave, the conveyor sieve will be forced to carry
more chaff than it can handle. The blast may be too
strong and carry over grain, so adjust the blinds that
the blast will be no stronger than is necessary to clean
the wheat well and keep sieves free. If grain is still carried
over, the conveyor sieve may be adjusted for more
open work, but care should be taken not to overwork the
shoe sieve. Be careful that the wind board is not bent
so that some grain will go into the fan and be thrown
out of the machine altogether.</p>

<p>If the grain is not separated from the straw thoroughly,
it may be due to “slugging” the cylinder (result of
poor feeding), causing a variable motion. It may also
be because speed of crank is not high enough. Check
board should be adjusted as low as possible to prevent
grain being carried on top of straw. See that cylinder
and concave teeth are properly adjusted so as not to
cut up straw, while at the same time threshing out all
the grain. Sometimes heads not threshed out by the
cylinder will be threshed out by the fan of the wind
stacker, and the fault will be placed on the separating
portions instead of on the imperfect cylinder.</p>

<p>Grain passes through the cylinder at the rate of about
a mile a minute. The beater reduces this to 1,500 feet
per minute. After passing the check board the straw
moves about 36 feet per minute. At these three different
speeds the straw passes the 17 feet length of the machine
in about 25 seconds. The problem is to stop the grain
while the straw is allowed to pass out. Evidently there
must be a small percentage of loss, and there is always
a limit as to what it will pay to try to save. Each man
must judge for himself.</p>


<h3>BALANCING A CYLINDER.</h3>

<p>A cylinder should be so balanced that it will come to
rest at any point. In a rough way a cylinder may be
balanced by placing the journals on two carpenter’s
squares laid on saw-horses. Gently roll the cylinder
back and forth and every time it stops, make a chalk
mark on the uppermost bar. If the same bar comes up
<a id="Page_171" href="#Page_171" class="pagenum" title="171"> </a>
three times in succession it probably is light, and a wedge
should be driven under center band at chalk mark.
Continue experimenting until cylinder will come to rest
at any point.</p>


<h3>COVERING PULLEYS.</h3>

<p>This is easily done, but care must be taken that the
leathers are tight or they will soon come off.</p>

<p>To cover a cylinder pulley, take off what remains of
the old cover, pull out the nails, and renew the wedges
if necessary. Select a good piece of leather a little wider
than face of pulley and about four inches longer than
enough to go around. Soak it in water for about an
hour. Cut one end square and nail it to the wedges,
using nails just long enough to clinch. Put a clamp
made of two pieces of wood and two bolts on the leather,
block the cylinder to keep it from turning, and by means
of two short levers pry over the clamp to stretch the
leather. Nail to the next wedges, move the clamp and
nail to each in turn, finally nailing to the first one again
before cutting off. Trim the edges even with the rim
of the pulley.</p>

<p>The same method may be used with riveted covers.</p>


<h3>CARE OF A SEPARATOR.</h3>

<p>A good separator ought to last ten years, and many
have been in use twice that time. After the season is
over the machine ought to be thoroughly cleaned and
stored in a dry place. Dirt on a machine holds moisture
and will ruin a separator during a winter if it is left on.
It also causes the wood to rot and sieves and iron work
to rust.</p>

<p>Once in two years at least a separator ought to have
a good coat of first-class coach varnish. Before varnishing,
clean off all grease and oil with benzine and see that
paint is bright.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the season give the machine a
thorough overhauling, putting new teeth in cylinder if
any are imperfect, and new slats in stacker web or straw
rack if they are needed. Worn boxes should be taken
up or rebabbitted, and conveyor and shoe eccentrics replaced
<a id="Page_172" href="#Page_172" class="pagenum" title="172"> </a>
if worn out. Tighten nuts, replace lost bolts,
leaving the nut always turned square with the piece it
rests on. Every separator ought to be covered with a
canvas during the season. It will pay.</p>

<p>The right and left sides of a threshing machine are
reckoned from the position of the feeder as he stands
facing the machine.</p>

<p>In case of fire, the quickest way is to let the engine
pull the machine out by the belt. Take blocks away
from wheels, place a man at end of tongue to steer, and
back engine slowly. If necessary, men should help the
wheels to start out of holes or soft places.</p>

<p>Watch the forks of the pitchers to see that none are
loose on the handles, especially if a self-feeder is used.
A pitchfork in a separator is a bad thing.</p>

boiler weakens it any?</p>

<p>A. Yes, to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Q. What effect has cold water on hot boiler plates?</p>

<p>A. It will fracture them.</p>

<p>Q. Where should the gauge cock be located?</p>

<p>A. The lowest gauge cock ought to be placed about
an inch and a half above the top row of flues.</p>

<p>Q. How would you have your blow-off located?</p>

<p>A. In the bottom of mud-drum or boiler.</p>

<p>A. With hammer and with hydrostatic test, using
warm water.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the single acting plunger pump; how it
gets and discharges its water?</p>

<p>A. The plunger displaces the air in the water pipe,
causing a vacuum which is filled by the atmosphere forcing
the water therein; the receiving valve closes and the
plunger forces the water out through the discharge
valve.</p>

<p>Q. What is the most economical boiler-feeder?</p>

in rain water now and then.</p>

<p>Q. If you found a thin plate, what would you do?</p>

<p>A. Put a patch on it.</p>

<p>Q. Would you put it on the inside or outside?</p>

<p>A. Inside.</p>

<p>A. Because the action that has weakened the plate
will then set on the patch, and when this is worn it can be
repeated.</p>

<a id="Page_176" href="#Page_176" class="pagenum" title="176"> </a>

<p>Q. If you found several thin places, what would you

heavy with coal or ashes, and when the boiler is sufficiently
cool put safety valve in working order.</p>

<p>Q. If water in boiler is suffered to get too low, what
may be the result?</p>

<p>A. Burn top of combustion chamber and tubes, perhaps
cause an explosion.</p>

<p>Q. If water is allowed to get too high, what result?</p>

<p>A. Cause priming, perhaps cause breaking of cylinder
covers or heads.</p>

<p>Q. What are the principal causes of foaming in boilers?</p>

<p>A. Dirty and impure water.</p>

<p>Q. How can foaming be stopped?</p>

<p>A. Close throttle and keep closed long enough to
show true level of water. If that level is sufficiently high,
feeding and blowing off will usually suffice to correct
the evil.</p>

<p>Q. What would you do if you should find your water
gone from sight very suddenly?</p>

<p>A. Draw the fires and cool off as quickly as possible.

running?</p>

<p>A. Never blow off more than one gauge of water at
a time while running.</p>

<p>Q. What general views have you in regard to boiler
explosions—what is the greatest cause?</p>

<p>A. Ignorance and neglect are the greatest causes of
boiler explosions.</p>

<p>Q. What precaution should the engineer take when
necessary to stop with heavy fires?</p>

<p>A. Close dampers, put on injector or pump and if a
bleeder is attached, use it.</p>

<p>Q. Where is the proper water level in boilers?</p>

<p>A. A safe water level is about two and a half inches
over top row of flues.</p>

and paint places with red lead; examine all stays
and braces to see if any are loose or badly worn.</p>

<p>Q. What is the last thing to do at night before leaving
plant?</p>

<p>A. Look around for greasy waste, hot coals, matches,
or anything which could fire the building.</p>

<p>Q. What would you do if you had a plant in good
working order?</p>

<p>A. Keep it so, and let well enough alone.</p>

power developed by an engine, to serve as a guide in
setting valves and showing the action of the steam in
the cylinder.</p>

<p>Q. How would you increase the power of an engine?</p>

<p>A. To increase the power of an engine, increase the
speed; or get higher pressure of steam, use less expansion.</p>

<p>Q. How do you find the horsepower of an engine?</p>

<p>A. By burning it; that is, by combustion.</p>

<p>Q. Of what does coal consist?</p>

<p>A. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen and
ash.</p>

<p>Q. What are the relative proportions of these that
enter into coal?</p>

<p>A. There are different proportions in different specimens
of coal, but the following shows the average per
cent: Carbon, 80; hydrogen, 5; nitrogen, 1; sulphur, 2;
oxygen, 7; ash, 5.</p>
<a id="Page_180" href="#Page_180" class="pagenum" title="180"> </a>

<p>Q. What must be mixed with coal before it will
burn?</p>

<p>A. Atmospheric air.</p>

<p>A. It is composed of nitrogen and oxygen in the proportion
of 77 of nitrogen to 23 of oxygen.</p>

<p>Q. What parts of the air mix with what parts of the
coal?</p>

<p>A. The oxygen of the air mixes with the carbon and
hydrogen of the coal.</p>

<p>Q. How much air must mix with the coal?</p>

<p>A. 150 cubic feet of air for every pound of coal.</p>

<p>Q. How many pounds of air are required to burn one

pound of hydrogen?</p>

<p>A. Thirty-six.</p>

<p>Q. Is hydrogen hotter than carbon?</p>

<p>A. Yes, four and one-half times hotter.</p>

<p>Q. What part of the coal gives out the most heat?</p>

<p>A. The hydrogen does part for part, but as there is
so much more of carbon than hydrogen in the coal we
get the greatest amount of heat from carbon.</p>

<p>Q. In how many different ways is heat transmitted?</p>

<p>A. Three; by radiation, by conduction and by convection.</p>

<p>Q. If the fire consisted of glowing fuel, show how
the heat enters the water and forms steam?</p>

<p>A. The heat from the glowing fuel passes by radiation
through the air space above the fuel to the furnace
crown. There it passes through the iron of the crown
by conduction. There it warms the water resting on the
crown, which then rises and parts with its heat to the
colder water by conduction till the whole mass of water
is heated. Then the heated water rises to the surface and
parts with its steam, so a constant circulation of water is
maintained by convection.</p>

<p>Q. What does water consist of?</p>

<p>A. Oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
<a id="Page_181" href="#Page_181" class="pagenum" title="181"> </a>

which expands itself in changing the nature of a body,
such as turning ice into water or water into steam.</p>

<p>Q. Under what circumstances do bodies get latent
heat?</p>

<p>A. When they are passing from a solid state to a
liquid or from a liquid to a gaseous state.</p>

<p>Q. How can latent heat be recovered?</p>

<p>A. By bringing the body back from a state of gas
to a liquid or from that of a liquid to that of a solid.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by a thermal unit?</p>

<p>A. The heat necessary to raise one pound of water
at 39 degrees Fn. 1 degree Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Q. If the power is in coal, why should we use steam?</p>

<p>A. Because steam has some properties which make it
an invaluable agent for applying the energy of the heat
to the engine.</p>

<p>Q. What is steam?</p>

<p>A. It is an invisible elastic gas generated from water
by the application of heat.</p>

<p>Q. What are its properties which make it so valuable
to us?</p>

<p>A. 1.—The ease with which we can condense it.
2.—Its great expansive power. 3.—The small space it
occupies when condensed.</p>

<p>Q. Why do you condense the steam?</p>

<p>A. To form a vacuum and so destroy the back pressure
that would otherwise be on the piston and thus get
more useful work out of the steam.</p>

<p>Q. What is vacuum?</p>

<p>A. A space void of all pressure.</p>

<p>Q. How do you maintain a vacuum?</p>

<p>A. By the steam used being constantly condensed
by the cold water or cold tubes, and the air pump as
constantly clearing the condenser out.</p>
<a id="Page_182" href="#Page_182" class="pagenum" title="182"> </a>

<p>Q. Why does condensing the used steam form a
vacuum?</p>

<p>A. Because a cubic foot of steam, at atmospheric
pressure, shrinks into about a cubic inch of water.</p>

<p>Q. What do you understand by the term horse
power?</p>

<p>A. A horse power is equivalent to raising 33,000
pounds one foot per minute, or 550 pounds raised one
foot per second.</p>

<p>Q. How do you calculate the horse power of tubular
or flue boilers?</p>

<p>A. For tubular boilers, multiply the square of the
diameter by length, and divide by four. For flue boilers,
multiply the diameter by the length and divide by
four; or, multiply area of grate surface in square feet
by 1½.</p>

<p>Q. What is the clearance of an engine as the term is
applied at the present time?</p>

<p>A. Clearance is the space between the cylinder head
and the piston head with the ports included.</p>

<p>Q. What are considered the greatest improvements
on the stationary engine in the last forty years?</p>

<p>A. The governor, the Corliss valve gear and the

<p>Q. From what cause do belts have the power to
drive shafting?</p>

<p>A. By friction or cohesion.</p>

<p>Q. What do you understand by lap?</p>

<p>A. Outside lap is that portion of valve which extends
beyond the ports when valve is placed on the
center of travel, and inside lap is that portion of valve
which projects over the ports on the inside or towards
the middle of valve.</p>

<p>Q. What is the use of lap?</p>

<p>A. To give the engine compression.</p>

<p>Q. What is the advantage of toughness in boiler
plate?</p>

<p>A. It stands irregular strains and sudden shocks better.</p>

<p>Q. What are the advantages of steel as a material
for boiler plates?</p>

<p>A. Homogeneity, tensile strength, malleability, ductility
and freedom from laminations and blisters.</p>

<p>Q. What are the disadvantages of steel as a material
for boiler plates?</p>

<p>A. It requires greater skill in working than iron,
and has, as bad qualities, brittleness, low ductility and
flaws induced by the pressure of gas bubbles in the ingot.</p>

<p>Q. When would you oil an engine?</p>

<p>A. Before starting it and as often while running as
necessary.</p>

<p>Q. How do you find proper size of any stay bolts
for a well made boiler?</p>

<p>A. First, multiply the given steam pressure per
square inch by the square of the distance between centers
of stay bolts, and divide the product by 6,000, and
call the answer “the quotient.” Second, divide “the quotient”
by .7854, and extract the square root of the last
quotient; the answer will give the required diameter of
stay bolts at the bottom of thread.</p>

<p>Q. In what position would you place an engine, to
take up any slack motion of the reciprocating parts?</p>

<p>A. Place engine in the position where the least wear
takes place on the journals. That is, in taking up the
wear of the crank-pin brasses, place the engine on either
dead center, as, when running, there is but little wear
upon the crank-pin at these points. If taking up the
cross-head pin brasses—without disconnecting and swinging
the rod—place the engine at half stroke, which is the
extreme point of swing of the rod, there being the least
wear on the brasses and cross-head pin in this position.</p>

<p>Q. What benefits are derived by using flywheels on
steam engines?</p>

<p>A. The energy developed in the cylinder while the
steam is doing its work is stored up in the flywheel, and
given out by it while there is no work being done in the
cylinder—that is, when the engine is passing the dead
<a id="Page_185" href="#Page_185" class="pagenum" title="185"> </a>
centers. This tends to keep the speed of the engine shaft
steady.</p>

<p>Q. Name several kinds of reducing motions, as used
in indicator practice?</p>

<p>A. The pantograph, the pendulum, the brumbo pulley,
the reducing wheel.</p>

<p>Q. How can an engineer tell from an indicator diagram
whether the piston or valves are leaking?</p>

<p>A. Leaky steam valves will cause the expansion curve
to become convex; that is, it will not follow hyperbolic
expansion, and will also show increased back pressure.
But if the exhaust valves leak also, one may offset the
other, and the indicator diagram would show no leak.</p>

<p>A leaky piston can be detected by a rapid falling in
the pressure on the expansion curve immediately after
the point of cut-off. It will also show increased back
pressure.</p>

<p>A falling in pressure in the upper portion of the compression
curve shows a leak in the exhaust valve.</p>

<p>Q. What would be the best method of treating a
badly scaled boiler, that was to be cleaned by a liberal
use of compound?</p>

<p>A. First open the boiler up and note where the loose
scale, if any, has lodged. Wash out thoroughly and put
in the required amount of compound. While the boiler
is in service, open the blow-off valve for a few seconds,
two or three times a day, to be assured that it does not
become stopped up with scale.</p>

<p>After running the boiler for a week, shut it down, and,
when the pressure is down and the boiler cooled off,
run the water out and take off the hand-hole plates. Note
what effect the compound has had on the scale, and where
the disengaged scale has lodged. Wash out thoroughly
and use judgment as to whether it is advisable to use a
less or greater quantity of compound, or to add a small
quantity daily.</p>

<p>Continue the washing out at short intervals, as many
boilers have been burned by large quantities of scale
dropping on the crown sheets and not being removed.</p>

<p>Q. If a condenser was attached to a side-valve engine,
<a id="Page_186" href="#Page_186" class="pagenum" title="186"> </a>
that had been set to run non-condensing, what
changes, if any, would be necessary?</p>

<p>A. More lap would have to be added to the valve to
cut off the steam at an earlier point of the stroke; if not,
the initial pressure into the cylinder would be throttled
down and the economy, to be gained from running condensing,
lessened.</p>

<p>Q. If you are carrying a vacuum equal to 27½ inches
of mercury, what should the temperature of the water
in the hot well be?</p>

<p>A. 108 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Q. Define specific gravity.</p>

<p>A. The specific gravity of a substance is the number
which expresses the relation between the weights of equal
volume of that substance, and distilled water of 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Q. Find the specific gravity of a body whose volume
is 12 cubic inches, and which floats in water with 7 cubic
inches immersed.</p>

<p>A. When a body floats in water, it displaces a quantity
of water equal to the weight of the floating body.
Thus, if a body of 12 cubic inches in volume floats with
7 cubic inches immersed, 7 cubic inches of water must
be equal in weight to 12 cubic inches of the substance
and one cubic inch of water to twelve-sevenths cubic
inches of the substance.</p>

<p>As specific gravity equals weight of one volume of
substance divided by weight of equal volume of water,
then specific gravity of the substance in this case equals
1 divided by twelve-sevenths.</p>

this product by twice the product of the length of

be the horsepower of the engine.</p>

<p>(Theoretically a horsepower is a power that will raise
33,000 pounds one foot in one minute.)</p>

<p>The power of fuel is measured theoretically from the
following basis: If a pound weight fall 780 feet in a
vacuum, it will generate heat enough to raise the temperature
of one pound of water one degree. Conversely,
power that will raise one pound of water one degree in
temperature will raise a one pound weight 780 feet.
The heat force required to turn a pound of water at 32
degrees into steam would lift a ton weight 400 feet high,
or develop two-fifths of one horsepower for an hour.
The best farm engine practically uses 35 pounds of water
per horsepower per hour, showing that one pound of
water would develop only one-thirty-fifth of a horsepower
in an hour, or 7&nbsp;1-7 per cent of the heat force
liberated. The rest of the heat force is lost in various
ways, as explained in the body of this book.</p>

<p>The following<a id="Marker_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="marker" title="Footnote 9">9</a> will assist in determining the amount
of power supplied to an engine:</p>

<p>“For instance, a 1-inch belt of the standard grade with
the proper tension, neither too tight or too loose, running
at a maximum speed of 800 feet a minute will
transmit one horsepower, running 1,600 feet two horsepower
and 2,400 feet three horsepower. A 2-inch belt
at the same speed, twice the power.</p>

<p>“Now if you know the circumference of your flywheel,
the number of revolutions your engine is making and
the width of belt, you can figure very nearly the amount
of power you can supply without slipping your belt. For
instance, we will say your flywheel is 40 inches in diameter
or 10.5 feet nearly in circumference and your engine
was running 225 revolutions a minute, your belt would
be traveling 225×10.5 feet = 2362.5 feet, or very nearly
2,400 feet, and if one inch of belt would transmit three
<a id="Page_189" href="#Page_189" class="pagenum" title="189"> </a>
horsepower running this speed, a 6-inch belt would
transmit eighteen horsepower, a 7-inch belt twenty-one
horsepower, an 8-inch belt twenty-four horsepower,
and so on. With the above as a basis for figuring you
can satisfy yourself as to the power you are furnishing.
To get the best results a belt wants to sag slightly, as it
hugs the pulley closer, and will last much longer.”</p>


<h3>KEYING PULLEYS.<a id="Marker_10a" href="#Footnote_10" class="marker" title="Footnote 10">10</a></h3>

<p>A key must be of equal width its whole length and
accurately fit the seats on shaft and in pulley. The thickness
should vary enough to make the taper correspond
with that of the seat in the pulley. The keys should be
driven in tight enough to be safe against working loose.
The hubs of most of the pulleys on the machine run
against the boxes, and in keying these on, about 1-32
of an inch end play to the shaft should be allowed, because
there is danger of the pulley rubbing so hard
against the end of the box as to cause it to heat.</p>

<p>A key that is too thin but otherwise fits all right can
be made tight by putting a strip of tin between the key
and the bottom of the seat in the pulley.</p>

<p><i>Drawing Keys.</i> If a part of the key stands outside of
the hub, catch it with a pair of horseshoe pinchers and
pry with them against the hub, at the same time hitting
the hub with a hammer so as to drive pulley on. A key
can sometimes be drawn by catching the end of it with
a claw hammer and driving on the hub of pulley. If
pulley is against box and key cut off flush with hub, take
the shaft out and use a drift from the inside, or if seat
is not long enough to make this possible, drive the pulley
on until the key loosens.</p>


<h3>BABBITTING BOXES.<a id="Marker_10b" href="#Footnote_10" class="marker" title="Footnote 10">10</a></h3>

<p>To babbitt any kind of a box, first chip out all of the
old babbitt and clean the shaft and box thoroughly with
benzine. This is necessary or gas will be formed from
the grease when the hot metal is poured in and leave
“blow holes.” In babbitting a <i>solid box</i> cover the shaft
<a id="Page_190" href="#Page_190" class="pagenum" title="190"> </a>
with paper, draw it smooth and tight, and fasten the
lapped ends with mucilage. If this is not done the shrinkage
of the metal in cooling will make it fast on the shaft,
so that it can’t be moved. If this happened it would be
necessary to put the shaft and box together in the fire
and melt the babbitt out or else break the box to get it
off. Paper around the shaft will prevent this and if
taken out when the babbitt has cooled the shaft will be
found to be just tight enough to run well.</p>

<p>Before pouring the box, block up the shaft until it is
in line and in center of the box and put stiff putty around
the shaft and against the ends of the box to keep the
babbitt from running out. Be sure to leave air-holes at
each end at the top, making a little funnel of putty
around each. Also make a larger funnel around the
pouring hole, or, if there is none, enlarge one of the air-holes
at the end and pour in that. The metal should be
heated until it is just hot enough to run freely and the
fire should not be too far away. When ready to pour
the box, don’t hesitate or stop, but pour continuously
and rapidly until the metal appears at the air holes. The
oil hole may be stopped with a wooden plug and if this
plug extends through far enough to touch the shaft, it
will leave a hole through the babbitt so that it will not
be necessary to drill one.</p>

<p><i>A split box</i> is babbitted in the same manner except
that strips of cardboard or sheet-iron are placed between
the two halves of the box and against the shaft to divide
the babbitt. To let the babbitt run from the upper half
to the lower, cut four or six V-shaped notches, a quarter
of an inch deep, in the edges of the sheet-iron or cardboard
that come against the shaft. Cover the shaft with
paper and put cardboard liners between the box to allow
for adjustment as it wears. Bolt the cap on securely
before pouring. When the babbitt has cooled, break the
box apart by driving a cold chisel between the two halves.
Trim off the sharp edges of the babbitt and with a round-nose
chisel cut oil grooves from the oil hole towards the
ends of the box and on the slack side of the box or the
one opposite to the direction in which the belt pulls.</p>
<a id="Page_191" href="#Page_191" class="pagenum" title="191"> </a>

<p>The ladle should hold six or eight pounds of metal.
If much larger it is awkward to handle and if too small
it will not keep the metal hot long enough to pour a good
box. The cylinder boxes on the separator take from
two to three pounds of metal each. If no putty is at
hand, clay mixed to the proper consistency may be used.
Use the best babbitt you can get for the cylinder boxes.
If not sure of the quality, use ordinary zinc. It is not
expensive and is generally satisfactory.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<p>Lime may be taken out of an injector by soaking it
over night in a mixture of one part of muriatic acid
and ten parts soft water. If a larger proportion of acid
is used it is likely to spoil the injector.</p>

<p>A good blacking for boilers and smokestacks is asphaltum
dissolved in turpentine.</p>

<p>To polish brass, dissolve 5 cents’ worth of oxalic acid
in a pint of water and use to clean the brass.   When
tarnish has been removed, dry and polish with chalk
or whiting.</p>

<p>It is said that iron or steel will not rust if it is placed
for a few minutes in a warm solution of washing soda.</p>

<p>Grease on the bottom of a boiler will stick there and
prevent the water from conducting away the heat. When
steel is thus covered with grease it will soon melt in a
hot fire, causing a boiler to burst if the steel is poor, or
warping it out of shape if the steel is good.</p>

<p>Sulphate of lime in water, causing scale, may be counteracted
and scale removed by using coal oil and sal
soda. When water contains carbonate of lime, molasses
will remove the scale.</p>


<h3>CODE OF WHISTLE SIGNALS.</h3>

<p>One short sound means to stop.</p>

<p>Two short sounds means the engine is about to begin
work.</p>

<p>Three medium short sounds mean that the machine
will soon need grain and grain haulers should hurry.</p>

<p>One rather long sound followed by three short ones
means the water is low and water hauler should hurry.</p>
<a id="Page_192" href="#Page_192" class="pagenum" title="192"> </a>

<p>A succession of short, quick whistles means distress

<span class="chapter-title">DIFFERENT  MAKES OF TRACTION  ENGINES.</span></h2>


<h3>J.&nbsp;I. CASE TRACTION ENGINES.</h3>

<p>These engines are among the simplest and at the same
time most substantial and durable traction engines on the
market. They are built of the best materials throughout,
and are one of the easiest engines for a novice to run.</p>

<p>They are of the side crank type, with spring mounting.
The engine is supported by a bracket bolted to the side
of the boiler, and a pillow block bearing at the firebox end
bolted to the side plate of the boiler.</p>

<p>The valve is the improved Woolf, a single simple
valve being used, worked by a single eccentric. The
eccentric strap has an extended arm pivoted in a wooden
block sliding in a guide. The direction of this guide can
be so changed by the reverse lever as to vary the cut-off
and easily reverse the engine when desired.</p>

<p>The engine is built either with a simple cylinder or
with a tandem compound cylinder.</p>

<p>In the operation of the differential gear, the power is
first transmitted to spur gear, containing cushion springs,
from thence by the springs to a center ring and four bevel
pinions which bear equally upon both bevel gears. The
whole differential consequently will move together as but
one wheel when engine is moving straight forward or
backward; but when turning a corner the four pinions
revolve in the bevel gears just in proportion to the sharpness
of the curve.</p>

<p>There is a friction clutch working on the inside of the
flywheel by means of two friction shoes that can be adjusted
as they wear.</p>

<p>There is a feed water heater with three tubes in a
watertight cylinder into which the exhaust steam is admitted.
The three tubes have smaller pipes inside so that
<a id="Page_194" href="#Page_194" class="pagenum" title="194"> </a>
the feed water in passing through forms a thin cylindrical
ring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_194">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="550" height="364" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>J.&nbsp;I. CASE TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The traction wheels are driven from the rims. The
front wheels have a square band on the center of the
rim, to prevent slipping sidewise. The smokestack is
cast iron in one piece.</p>

<p>The firebox will burn wood, coal or straw, a fire brick
arch being used for straw, making this fuel give a uniform
heat.</p>
<a id="Page_195" href="#Page_195" class="pagenum" title="195"> </a>

<p>The boiler is of the simple locomotive type, with water
leg around the firebox and numerous fire flues connecting
the firebox with the smokestack in front. There
is safety plug in crown sheet and the usual fittings. The
water tank is under the platform. The steering wheel
and band wheel are on right side of engine. An independent
Marsh pump and injector are used. The Marsh
pump is arranged to heat the feed water when exhaust
heater cannot be used. The governor is the Waters,
the safety valve the Kunkle.</p>


<h3>THE FRICK CO.’S TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The most noticeable feature of this engine is that it
has a frame mounted on the traction wheels entirely
independent of the boiler, thus relieving the boiler of
all strain. This is
an undeniable advantage,
since usually
the strain on
the boiler is great
enough without
forcing the boiler to
carry the engine
and gears.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_195">
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE FRICK CO.’S TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The gearing to
the traction wheels
is simple and direct,
and a patent elastic
spring or cushion connection is used which avoids sudden
strain and possible breakage of gears. Steel traction
wheels and riveted spokes. Differential gear in
main axle, with locking device when both traction
wheels are required to pull out of a hole. The reverse
gear is single eccentric, the eccentric turning on
the shaft. It is well adapted to using steam expansively.
The crown sheet is so arranged as not to be
left bare of water in going up or down hills. Working
parts are covered dust proof. Engine has self-oiling
features and sight feed lubricator. Friction clutch in
flywheel. Safety brake on main axle. Engineer’s platform
<a id="Page_196" href="#Page_196" class="pagenum" title="196"> </a>
mounted on springs and every part of engine requiring
attention can be reached conveniently from platform.</p>

<p>Crank is center type. Cross-head pump is used. Usual
fittings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_196">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="550" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>GAAR, SCOTT &amp; CO.’S TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These engines are built with boiler of locomotive type
for burning wood and coal, and of return flue type for
burning straw.   They are also built of three general
<a id="Page_197" href="#Page_197" class="pagenum" title="197"> </a>
types, “Corliss-pattern” frame, “Standard” and “Compound.”</p>

<p>The engine is side crank, mounted on brackets attached
to the sides of the boiler. The bedplate, cylinder
and guides are bored at one operation and cannot get
out of alignment. Cylinder has wide ports and free
exhaust, and piston has self-setting rings. The genuine
link reverse gear is used, as on locomotives, and it undoubtedly
has many advantages over any other, including
an easily adjustable variable cut-off by correct setting
of reverse lever.</p>

<p>The differential gear is heavy and effective. A patent
steering attachment, with spiral roll, holds chains taut
and gives positive motion. Friction clutch is mounted
on engine shaft and connects with the hub of the pinion
on this shaft. Rigid pinion is also provided. Cross-head
pump and injector are used, and Pickering governor
with improved spring speeder, permitting quick and
easy change of speed; also Sawyer’s lever for testing
safety. Steam passes direct from dome to cylinder, without
loss from cooling or condensing. The steel water
tank can be filled by a jet pump operated by steam.</p>


<h3>D. JUNE &amp; CO.’S TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>This is one of the very few traction engines built with
upright boiler, but it has been on the market many years
and has been widely used with great success as a general
road locomotive.</p>

<p>The engine is mounted on the water tank. The weight
of the boiler comes on the hind wheels, and makes this
type of engine superior for pulling. It is claimed that
it has no equal on the market as a puller. The upright
type of boiler has the advantage that the crown sheet
is never exposed and it is claimed flues will last longer
than in horizontal type. It works equally well whether
it stands level or not, an advantage that no other type
has.</p>

<p>This type gets up steam more quickly than any other—it
is said, from cold water, in twenty minutes. The steam
is superheated in a way to economize fuel and water.
<a id="Page_198" href="#Page_198" class="pagenum" title="198"> </a>
By being mounted on the tank, the engine does not get
hot as it would if mounted on the boiler, and the corresponding
straining of parts is avoided. A patent water
spark arrester is used which is an absolute protection.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_198">
<img src="images/i_198.jpg" width="550" height="472" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>D. JUNE &amp; CO.’S TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The engine is geared to the traction by a chain, which
can easily be repaired as the links wear. The friction
clutch works inside flywheel. Engine has a new reversible
eccentric, and differential gear, with usual fittings.</p>
<a id="Page_199" href="#Page_199" class="pagenum" title="199"> </a>


<h3>NICHOLS &amp; SHEPARD TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The builders of this engine lay special stress upon the
care with which the boiler and similar parts are constructed.
The important seams are double riveted, and
the flue sheet is half inch steel, drilled instead of punched
for the flues, and fitted with seamless steel flues, all of the
best steel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_199">
<img src="images/i_199.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>NICHOLS &amp; SHEPARD TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The boiler is the direct flue locomotive type. The crown
<a id="Page_200" href="#Page_200" class="pagenum" title="200"> </a>
sheet slopes backward to allow it to be covered with water
in descending hills. Boiler has round-bottom firebox.
Axle passes around below the boiler, and springs are provided.</p>

<p>The engine is mounted on a long heater, which is attached
to the side of the boiler. The locomotive link reverse
is used, with a plain slide valve.</p>

<p>Cross-head pump and injector are used, and improved
pop safety valve. Cylinder is jacketed, and cross-head
guides are rigid with cylinder, so that perfect alignment
is always secured.</p>

<p>Engines are built to burn coal or wood. A straw burner
is provided with firebrick arch. Compound engines
are also built.</p>


<h3>THE HUBER TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Huber boiler is of the return flue type, and the
gates are in the large central tube. This does away with
the low-hanging firebox, and enables the engine to cross
streams and straddle stumps as the low firebox type cannot
do. The cylindrical shape of the boiler also adds
considerably to its strength.  The water tank is carried in
front, and swings
around so as to
open the smoke box,
so that repairs may
be made on the fire
tubes at this end
easily in the open
air. With water
front return flue
boilers the workman
has to crawl through
entire length of central
flue. As there
is no firebox, the boiler is mounted above the axle,
not by bolting a plate to the side of the firebox.
The boiler is made fast to the axle, which is
mounted on wheels with spring cushion gear, the springs
being placed in the wheel itself, between the two bearings
<a id="Page_201" href="#Page_201" class="pagenum" title="201"> </a>
of the wheel or the hub on trunnions, which form the
spindle for the hub. The wheel revolves on the trunnion
instead of on the axle, and there is no wear on the axle.
The traction gear has a spring connection so that in starting
a load there is little danger of breakage. The compensating
gear is all spur. The intermediate gear has a
ten-inch bearing, with an eccentric in the center for adjusting
the gear above and below. There is a spring
draw bar and elastic steering device. An improved friction
clutch works on inside of flywheel. Engine has a
special governor adapted to varying work over rough
roads, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_200">
<img src="images/i_200.jpg" width="400" height="284" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE HUBER TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A single eccentric reverse gear is used, with arm and
wood slide block (Woolf); and there is a variable exhaust,
by which a strong draft may be quickly created by
shutting off one of two exhaust nozzles. When both
exhausts are open, back pressure is almost entirely relieved.</p>

<p>The steam is carried in a pipe down through the middle
of the central flue, so that superheating is secured,
which it is claimed makes a saving of over 8 per cent in
fuel and water. The stack is double walled with air space
between the walls.</p>

<p>A special straw-burning engine is constructed with a
firebox extension in front, and straw passes over the
end of a grate in such a way as to get perfect combustion.
This make of engine is peculiarly adapted to burning
straw successfully.</p>


<h3>A.&nbsp;W. STEVENS’ TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>This engine has locomotive pattern boiler, with sloping
crown sheet, and especially high offset over firebox, doubling
steam space that will give dry steam at all times. A
large size steam pipe passes from dome in rear through
boiler to engine in front, superheating steam and avoiding
condensation from exposure. Grate is a rocking one,
easily cleaned and requiring little attention, and firedoor
is of a pattern that remains air-tight and need seldom be
opened.</p>
<a id="Page_202" href="#Page_202" class="pagenum" title="202"> </a>

<p>The engine is mounted upon the boiler, arranged for
rear gear traction attachment. Engine frame, cylinder,
guides, etc., are cast in one solid piece.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_202">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="550" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A.&nbsp;W. STEVENS’ TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has a special patented single eccentric reverse, and
Pickering horizontal governor. There is a friction clutch,
Marsh steam pump, and injector. Other fittings are complete,
and engine is well made throughout.</p>
<a id="Page_203" href="#Page_203" class="pagenum" title="203"> </a>


<h3>AULTMAN-TAYLOR TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Aultman-Taylor Traction Engine is an exceptionally
well made engine of the simplest type, and has been
on the market over 25 years. There are two general
types, the wood and coal burners with locomotive boilers,
and return flue boiler style for burning straw. A compound
engine is also made with the Woolf single valve
gear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_203">
<img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>AULTMAN-TAYLOR TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A special feature of this engine is that the rear axle
comes behind the firebox instead of between the firebox
and the front wheels. This distributes the weight of the
engine more evenly. The makers do not believe in springs
for the rear axle,
since they have a
tendency to wear
the gear convex or
round, and really
accomplish much
less than they are
supposed to.</p>

<p>Another special
point is the bevel
traction gear. The
engine is mounted
on the boiler well
toward the front,
and the flywheel is near the stack (in the locomotive
type). By bevel gears and a long shaft the power is conducted
to the differential gear in connection with the rear
wheels. The makers claim that lost motion can be taken
up in a bevel gear much better than in a spur gear. Besides,
the spur gear is noisy and not nearly so durable.
Much less friction is claimed for this type of gear.</p>

<p>The governor is the Pickering; cross-head pump is
used, with U.&nbsp;S. injector; heater, and other fittings complete.
A band friction clutch is used, said to be very durable.
Diamond special spark arrester is used except in
straw burners. The platform and front bolster are provided
with springs.    The makers especially recommend
<a id="Page_204" href="#Page_204" class="pagenum" title="204"> </a>
their compound engine, claiming a gain of about 25 per
cent. The use of automatic band cutters and feeders, automatic
weighers and baggers, and pneumatic stackers with
threshing machine outfits make additional demands on an
engine that is best met by the compound type. With large
outfits, making large demands, the compound engine gives
the required power without undue weight.</p>


<h3>AVERY TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Avery is an engine with a return flue boiler and
full water front, and also is arranged with a firebox besides.
There is no doubt that it effects the greatest economy
of fuel possible, and is adaptable equally for wood,
coal, or straw.   The boiler is so built that a man may
readily crawl
through the large
central flue and get
at the front ends of
the return tubes to
repair them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_204">
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>AVERY TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The side gear is
used with a crank
disc instead of arm.
The reverse is the
Grime, a single eccentric
with device
for shifting for reverse. The friction clutch has unusually
long shoes, working inside the flywheel, with ample
clearance when lever is off. A specialty is made of extra
wide traction wheels for soft country. The traction gear
is of the spur variety. There is also a double speed device
offered as an extra.</p>

<p>The water tank is carried in front, and lubricator, steering
wheel (on same side as band wheel for convenience
in lining up with separator), reverse lever, friction
clutch, etc., are all right at the hand of the engineer.</p>

<p>The traction gear is of the spur variety, adjusted to be
evenly distributed to both traction wheels through the
compensating gear, and to get the best possible pull in
case of need.</p>
<a id="Page_205" href="#Page_205" class="pagenum" title="205"> </a>

<p>For pulling qualities and economy of fuel, this engine is
especially recommended.</p>


<h3>BUFFALO PITTS TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Buffalo Pitts Engine is built either single cylinder
or double cylinder. The boiler is of the direct flue locomotive
type, with full water bottom firebox. The straw
burners are provided with a firebrick arch in the firebox.
Boilers are fully jacketed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_205">
<img src="images/i_205.jpg" width="550" height="410" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BUFFALO PITTS TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>
<a id="Page_206" href="#Page_206" class="pagenum" title="206"> </a>

<p>The single and double cylinder engines differ only in
this one particular, the double cylinder having the advantage
of never being on a dead center and starting with
perfect smoothness and gently, seldom throwing off belt.
The frame has bored guides, in same piece with cylinder,
effecting perfect alignment.</p>

<p>The compensating gear is of the bevel type, half
shrouded and so close together that sand and grit are kept
out. Three pinions are used, which it is claimed prevent
rocking caused by two or four pinions.</p>

<p>Cross-head has shoes unusually long and wide. The
engine frame is of the box pattern, and is also used as a
heater, feed water for either injector or steam pump passing
through it. Valve is of the plain locomotive slide
type.</p>

<p>The friction clutch has hinged arms working into flywheel
with but slight beveling on flywheel inner surface,
and being susceptible of easy release. It is a specially
patented device. The Woolf single eccentric reverse gear
is used. Engine is fully provided with all modern fittings
and appliances in addition to those mentioned. It was
the only traction engine exhibited at Pan-American Exposition
which won gold medal or highest award. It
claims extra high grade of workmanship and durability.</p>


<h3>THE REEVES TRACTION ENGINES.</h3>

<p>These engines are made in two styles, simple double
cylinder and cross compound. The double cylinder and
cross compound style have been very successfully adapted
to traction engine purposes with certain advantages that
no other style of traction engine has. With two cylinders
and two pistons placed side by side, with crank pins at
right angles on the shaft, there can be no dead centers, at
which an engine will be completely stuck. Then sudden
starting is liable to throw off the main belt. With a double
cylinder engine the starting is always gradual and
easy, and never fails.</p>

<p>The same is equally true of the cross compound, which
has the advantage of using the steam expansively in the
low pressure cylinder.  In case of need the live steam may
<a id="Page_207" href="#Page_207" class="pagenum" title="207"> </a>
be introduced into the low pressure cylinder, enormously
increasing the pulling power of the engine for an emergency,
though the capacity of the boiler does not permit
long use of both cylinders in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_207">
<img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="550" height="387" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE REEVES TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The engine is placed on top of the firebox portion of
the boiler, and the weight is nicely balanced so that it
comes on both sides alike.</p>
<a id="Page_208" href="#Page_208" class="pagenum" title="208"> </a>

<p>The gearing is attached to the axle and countershaft
which extend across the engine. The compensating gear
is strong and well covered from dirt. The gearing is the
gear type, axle turning with the drivers. There is an
independent pump; also injector, and all attachments. The
band wheel being on the steering wheel or right side of
the engine, makes it easy to line up to a threshing machine.
Engine frame is of the Corliss pattern; boiler of
locomotive type, and extra strongly built.</p>


<h3>THE RUMELY TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The most striking peculiarity is that the engine is
mounted on the boiler differently from most side crank
traction engines, the cylinder being forward and the
shaft at the rear. This brings the gearing nearer the
traction wheels and reduces its weight and complication.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_208">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE RUMELY TRACTION ENGINE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The boiler is of the round bottom firebox type, with
dome in front and an ash pan in lower part of firebox,
and is unusually well built and firmly riveted.</p>

<p>The traction wheels are usually high, and the flywheel
is between one wheel and the boiler.</p>

<p>The engine frame is of the girder pattern, with overhanging
cylinder attached to one end.</p>

<p>The boiler is of the direct flue locomotive type, fitted
for straw, wood, or coal.  Beam axle of the engine is behind
<a id="Page_209" href="#Page_209" class="pagenum" title="209"> </a>
the firebox, and is a single solid steel shaft. Front
axle is elliptical, and so stronger than any other type.</p>

<p>A double cylinder engine is now being built as well as
the single cylinder. The governor regulates the double
cylinder engine more closely than single cylinder types,
and in the Rumely is very close to the cut-off where a
special simple reverse is used with the double cylinder
engine.</p>

<p>Engine is supplied with cross-head pump and injector,
Arnold shifting eccentric reverse gear, friction clutch, and
large cylindrical water tank on the side. It also has the
usual engine and boiler fittings.</p>


<h3>PORT HURON TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Port Huron traction engine is of the direct flue
locomotive type, built either simple or compound, and of
medium weight and excellent proportions for general
purpose use. The compound engine (tandem Woolf
cylinders) is especially recommended and pushed as
more economical than the simple cylinder engine. As
live steam can be admitted to the low pressure cylinder,
so turning the compound into a simple cylinder engine
with two cylinders, enormous power can be obtained at
a moment’s notice to help out at a difficult point.</p>

<p>Two injectors are furnished with this engine, and the
use of the injector is recommended, contrary to the general
belief that a pump is more economical. The company
contends that the long exhaust pipe causes more
back pressure on the cylinder than would be represented
by the saving of heat in the heater. However, a cross-head
pump and special condensing heater will be furnished
if desired.</p>

<p>On the simple engine a piston valve is used, the seat
of the valve completely surrounding it and the ports
being circular openings, the result, it is claimed, being
a balanced valve.</p>

<p>The valve reverse gear is of the Woolf pattern, the
engine frame of the girder type, Waters governor, with
special patent speed changer, specially balanced crank
disc, patent straw burner arrangement for straw burning
<a id="Page_210" href="#Page_210" class="pagenum" title="210"> </a>
engines, special patent spark extinguisher, special
patent gear lock, and special patents on front axle, drive
wheel and loco cab.</p>

<p>The usual fittings are supplied.</p>

<h3>MINNEAPOLIS TRACTION ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The Minneapolis traction engine is built both simple
and compound. All sizes and styles have the return
flue boiler, for wood, coal or straw. Both axles extend
entirely and straight under the boiler, giving complete
<a id="Page_212" href="#Page_212" class="pagenum" title="212"> </a>
support without strain. The cylinder, steam chest and
guides form one piece, and are mounted above a heater,
secured firmly to the boiler; valve single simple D pattern.
Special throttle of the butterfly pattern, large crank
pin turned by special device after it is driven in, so insuring
perfect adjustment; special patent exhaust nozzle
made adjustable and so as always to throw steam in
center of stack; friction clutch with three adjustable
shoes. Boiler is supplied with a superheater pipe. Woolf
valve and reverse gear. Special heavy brass boxes and
stuffing-boxes. Sight feed lubricator and needle feed
oiler; Gardner spring governor. Complete with usual
fittings. This is a simply constructed but very well made
engine.</p>

<p class="title">“PRACTICAL USES OF THE STEEL SQUARE”</p>

<p>A Modern Treatise by Fred T. Hodgson. An exhaustive work including a
brief history of the Square; a description of many of the Squares that are
now, and have been in the market, including some very ingenious devices for
laying out Bevels for Rafters, Braces and other inclined work; also chapters
on the Square as a calculating machine, showing how to measure Solids, Surfaces
and Distances—very useful to builders and estimators. Chapters on
roofing and how to form them by the aid of the Square; Octagon, Hexagon,
Hip and other Roofs are shown and explained, and the manner of getting the
rafters and jacks given; Chapters on heavy timber framing, showing how
the Square is used for laying out Mortises, Tenons, Shoulders, Inclined
Work, Angle Corners and similar work.</p>

<p>The work abounds with hundreds of fine illustrations and explanatory
diagrams, which will prove a perfect mine of instruction for the mechanic,
young or old.</p>

<p class="title"><i>Common-Sense Handrailings
and How to Build Them</i></p>

<div class="figleft w300">

</div>

<p><span class="upper">This new volume</span> contains
three distinct treatises on the
subject, each of which is complete
in itself. The system of forming
the lines for obtaining the various
curves, wreaths, ramps and face
moulds for handrails are the simplest
in use and those employed by
the most successful handrailers. Mr.
Hodgson has placed this unusually
intricate subject before his readers
in a very plain and easily understood
manner, and any workman having a
fair knowledge of “lines” and who
can construct an ordinary straight
stairway can readily grasp the whole
system of “handrailing” after a
small study of this work.</p>

<p>The building of stairs and properly making and placing over them
a graceful handrail and suitable balusters and newel posts is one of
the greatest achievements of the joiner’s art and skill, yet it is an art
that is the least understood of any of the constructive processes the
carpenter or joiner is called upon to accomplish. In but very few of
the plans made by an architect are the stairs properly laid down or
divided off; indeed, most of the stairs as laid out and planned by the
architect, are impossible ones owing to the fact that the circumstances
that govern the formation of the rail, are either not understood,
or not noticed by the designer, and the expert handrailer
often finds it difficult to conform the stairs and rail to the plan.
Generally, however, he gets so close to it that the character or the
design is seldom changed.<!--TN: added period--></p>

<p>The stairs are the great feature of a building as they are the first
object that meets the visitor and claims his attention, and it is essential,
therefore, that the stair and its adjuncts should have a neat and
graceful appearance, and this can only be accomplished by having
the rail properly made and set up.</p>

<p>This little book gives such instructions in the art of handrailing as
will enable the young workman to build a rail so that it will assume
a handsome appearance when set in place. There are eleven distinct
styles of stairs shown, but the same principle that governs the making

so, once having mastered the simple problems in this system, progress
in the art will become easy, and a little study and practice will
enable the workman to construct a rail for the most tortuous

<div class="figleft w250">
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="240" height="400" alt="How to Construct and Maintain Telephone Lines" />
</div>

<p>Containing chapters on “The Use
of the Telephone, Series and Bridging
phones, Line Construction, Materials
to be used, Locating and Correction
of Faults in Instruments
and Lines.”</p>

<p>This is the best book ever published
on Farm Telephones and has
been the sensation of the past year
in telephone circles. It is the only
book ever issued which treats the
subject exhaustively and comprehensively.
It is of inestimable value
to promoters of rural party lines
because it contains all of the arguments
that are necessary to show
the advantages of rural party lines.
It also tells how such lines should
be constructed and cared for.</p>

<p>The great growth of the telephone industry during the past
few years, and in response to the demand for a comprehensive
book, giving a clear, terse idea of the different principles governing
the construction, installation, care and management of the
various telephones and their appliances, the Practical Telephone
Hand Book has been compiled. It is written in a most clear and
careful style and aims to give a complete review of the subject
of telephony.</p>

<p>No expense has been spared in gathering valuable information,
and it has been the aim of the author to make this treatise
the most complete elementary book ever written on this subject
for all persons interested in this great achievement of modern
science.</p>

<p>The text is profusely illustrated by cuts of commercial apparatus
and carefully prepared diagrams of circuits. No diagram
is given without a full explanation. The apparatus and
methods used in making all the tests required in commercial
telephone work, including the exchange, are fully treated.</p>

<p class="title">BOOKKEEPING
SELF-TAUGHT</p>

<p class="center larger"><i>By PHILLIP C. GOODWIN</i></p>

<div class="figleft w300">
<img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="280" height="400" alt="Bookkeeping Self-taught" />
</div>

<p><span class="upper">Few</span>, if any of<!--TN: deleted doubled 'of'--> the technical works,
which purport to be self-instructing
have justified the claims made for
them, and invariably the student
either becomes discouraged and abandons
his purpose and aim, or he is compelled to
enlist the offices of a professional teacher,
which in the great majority of instances is
impracticable when considered in relation
to the demands upon time and the condition
of life to which the great busy public is
subjected.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodwin’s treatise on Bookkeeping
is an entirely new departure from all
former methods of self-instruction and one
which can be studied systematically and
alone by the student with quick and
permanent results, or taken up in leisure
moments with an absolute certainty of acquiring
the science in a very short time and
with little effort. The book is both a
marvel of skill and simplicity. Every
feature and every detail leading to the
climax of scientific perfection are so thoroughly
complete in this logical procedure
and the analysis so thorough and deftly made that the self-teaching
student is led by almost imperceptible, but sure and certain steps to
the basic principles of the science, which the author in a most comprehensive
and lucid style lays bare to intelligence of, even the most
mediocre order.</p>

<p>The work is the most masterly exposition of the scientific principles of
Bookkeeping and their practical application which has ever appeared in the
English language, and it should be in the hands of every school boy or girl,
every clerk, farmer, teacher and business or professional man; for a
knowledge of Bookkeeping, even though it may not be followed as a profession,
is a necessity felt by every person in business life and a recognized
prime factor of business success.</p>

<p>In addition to a very simple yet elaborate explanation in detail of the
systems of both single and double entry Bookkeeping, beginning with the
initial transactions and leading the student along to the culminating exhibit
of the balance sheet, the work contains a glossary of all the commercial
terms employed in the business world, together with accounts in illustration,
exercises for practice and one set of books completely written up.</p>
